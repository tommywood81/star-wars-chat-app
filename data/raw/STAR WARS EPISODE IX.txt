EPISODE IX
DUEL OF THE FATES
The iron grip of the FIRST ORDER has
spread to the farthest reaches of the
galaxy. Only a few scattered planets
remain unoccupied. Traitorous acts
are punishable by death.
Determined to suffocate a growing
unrest, Supreme Leader KYLO REN has
silenced all communication between
neighboring systems.
Led by GENERAL LEIA ORGANA, the
Resistance has planned a secret
mission to prevent their annihilation
and forge a path to freedom...
EXT. SPACE
A rich tapestry of stars, reaching beyond all we know.
Two sharp points of a space station enclose the sides of the
frame as we drift backwards into the glowing rectangular
entrance of a DOCKING BAY.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DOCKING BAY - DAY
A FIRST ORDER TRANSPORT touches down. A wide platform
descends, revealing a variety of DROIDS.
A GRAPHITE BB UNIT carefully splits off from the group.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - CORRIDOR - DAY
The graphite BB Unit swerves to avoid a brutish LABOR DROID,
scraping BB’s spherical side against the wall.
His head tilts down, checking a scuff in his paint, revealing
ORANGE beneath. It’s BB-8, DEEP UNDERCOVER.
He lets out a familiar “uh-oh” and rotates the orange scuff
beneath his head.
INT. SURVEILLANCE DEN - KUAT MOON - DAY
A comm device blinks in a cramped room stacked with recycled
Imperial gear. ROSE TICO, adventure-worn and battle ready,
grabs it with gloved hands.
ROSE
BB-8, you in?
BB-8 BEEPS affirmative. Rose looks up through the broken roof
at the ORBITAL RING in the sky above. Star Destroyers
protrude from it like spikes on a punk bracelet.
ROSE (CONT'D)
I need eyes on the checkpoint.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DAY
BB-8 plugs into a scomp terminal, anxious, tense. Out the
window, the glowing KUAT MOON, sun cresting its horizon.
2.
INT. SURVEILLANCE DEN - KUAT SURFACE - DAY
A holomonitor grid lights up, blurred and scrambled. Rose
straps electrogoggles over her cracked leather flight helmet.
ROSE
Atta boy.
ROSE’S POV: The images unscramble, revealing a SECURITY
CHECKPOINT. The HUD zooms on an approaching DROPSHIP.
ROSE (CONT'D)
Here they come.
EXT. KUAT MOON - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
The Dropship touches down in a canyon of white and blue
sedimentary rock, kicking up a storm of silver sand.
STORMTROOPERS shield their eyes as the craft spits out a new
batch of MIGRANT WORKERS from all corners of the galaxy--
aliens and humans submitting to the First Order in exchange
for safety and a scrap of food.
Stormtroopers funnel the migrants toward a Weapons Detector.
We notice FINN disguised in rags among them.
FINN
Checkpoint. Keep your head down.
A ROBED HUMAN nods, face hidden under dusty headwear.
A bottleneck quickly forms. The ragged aliens bark at each
other in a dozen languages. A beast-like DROVIAN shoves Finn.
FINN (CONT'D)
Whoa, hey. No trouble here.
The Drovian grabs Finn’s neck with a single hand and lifts
him up, teeth bared.
FINN (CONT'D)
Trouble. TROUBLE!
The robed human steps between them. POE DAMERON.
POE
Easy, pal.
Poe pulls a dried three-eyed Peckto fish from a leather pouch
beneath his robe.
3.
POE (CONT'D)
Here. I couldn’t finish it.
The Drovian eyes the fish, drops Finn, eats.
We notice Poe’s hand on a CONCEALED BLASTER beneath his robe.
Finn regains his footing, clenching his neck.
FINN
Thanks.
Poe shoots him a tense look. They move toward the scanner.
FINN (CONT'D)
How’ll we know if BB-8 hacked the
mainframe?
The weapons scanner ALARMS. Stormtroopers pull a mangy GOTAL
out of the group. He pleads, pointing desperately to his
metallic horns. Blasters FIRE.
POE
We’ll know.
Poe and Finn step into the weapons scanner. Just as they
enter, the machine SHUDDERS AND CLICKS OFF.
STORMTROOPER #1
We lost power. Hold the line.
Stormtroopers step in front of the scanner, blasters smoking.
Finn and Poe eye each other, tense.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DAY
BB-8’s scomp link stutters and spins. A Stormtrooper drops a
crate of spanners nearby. BB-8 STARTLES as they clatter
across the floor. Droid sweat.
EXT. KUAT MOON - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
The Stormtrooper smacks the console. It powers up again with
our armed infiltrators standing inside it. No alarm.
STORMTROOPER
Go on, get moving.
Our guys exhale. Still alive.
4.
EXT. KUAT WORKERS COLONY - DAY
Poe and Finn pass through the border wall to reveal a VAST
MIGRANT SETTLEMENT. Modular housing painted with colorful
symbols from each worker’s home world, a vibrant melting pot.
The Orbital Ring looms above, connected to the planet’s
surface by a massive POWERSHAFT plunged directly into the
core. It glows blue with the ship-fueling energy mined here.
Poe locks eyes with BISS KOVA, a furry alien watching from a
machine shop. Biss taps his cheek.
POE
That’s our guy.
Nearby, a suspicious TUSKEN, face wrapped. The Tusken eyes
Finn and Poe as they follow Biss Kova inside a hut.
INT. MIGRANT HUT - DAY
A big-cheeked, hairless ALIEN BABY bounces in a hanging sea
cow stomach while Biss’ partner DAL KOVA brushes an
unappetizing roast with melted fat.
Rose emerges from behind a beaded curtain in the back.
ROSE
You said two days, I’ve been here
two weeks.
FINN
This place doesn’t seem so bad.
ROSE
Good people. Terrible food.
Rose rolls a canvas map onto the table.
ROSE (CONT'D)
This is our access point.
She drops a holochip. It projects the Orbital Ring and the
powershaft plunging from it into the moon’s core.
ROSE (CONT'D)
This powershaft delivers raw ore to
orbital ring. A detonation directly
into the energy stream, here, will
cause a chain reaction--
A blinking holographic light shoots up into the Orbital Ring,
causing a series of explosions around the entire structure.
5.
POE
--and take the whole thing down.
Finn looks up through the broken roof at the ORBITAL RING
above. A dozen Star Destroyers fueling up.
FINN
Along with their new fleet.
POE
How do we know they haven’t
detected BB-8’s signature?
The alien baby starts to CRY. Rose picks up a rattle and
shakes it.
POE (CONT'D)
There’s a lot we don’t know. That’s
why I voted for the other plan.
FINN
This is when we second guess the
plan? Right now?
Rose sticks a finger into the alien baby’s mouth.
ROSE
We can take out the enemy’s fuel
source and be light years away
before they know what hit them. But
we have to move now.
Finn and Poe regard this odd moment. Rose really has been
down here awhile.
POE
Okay, let’s blow this thing and go
home.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - DAY
Poe, Finn and Rose move past migrant workers toward the
massive POWERSHAFT BASE extending to the sky.
The Tusken follows them in the deep background.
POE
BB-8? Don’t worry, I’m alive.
Unlock the powershaft doors and get
ready with that shuttle.
6.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DAY
BB-8 detatches his scomp link and speeds down the corridor.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
A trio of space-gray MECHTROOPERS guard the door.
WHACK! Poe makes short work of the first Mechtrooper,
knocking him unconscious. Finn and Rose quietly take down the
other two with electric SHOCK PRODS.
Poe unlatches a device from the Mechtrooper’s belt, throws it
to Finn. He SCANS IT on the wall.
INT. POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
A massive cylinder of particle energy rushing upwards.
Finn, Poe and Rose approach it and gaze up, dwarfed.
POE
We’ll have twenty seconds before
detonation. Give or take.
ROSE
Give or take how long?
Poe hands out three FLYING THERMAL DETONATORS.
POE
Nice and easy. Just like pitching
Pilmetto Stick.
FINN
We didn’t have that...
(Poe activates his charge)
Oh we’re going now?!
Poe underhand tosses his charge into the stream where it
ROCKETS UPWARDS in the particle flow. Rose throws hers.
Finn chucks his like a live grenade and runs.
POE
(into comm)
BB-8, bombs are away. We’ll meet
you at the relay point.
7.
INT. MAINTENANCE SHUTTLE DOCK - DAY
BB-8 rolls into the droid slot of a tiny Maintenance Shuttle,
old and forgotten.
The ship POWERS UP.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
Our heroes exit through the maintance door...
...to find themselves face-to-face with a platoon of
STORMTROOPERS and MECHTROOPERS.
STORMTROOPER
Drop your weapons!
Migrant workers crane their necks from the village. The
masked Tusken lurks among them.
Poe eyes the orbital ring, anticipating the explosion.
POE
Distraction in three, two, one...now!
Poe dives, rolls, head covered...but nothing happens.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
A FIRST ORDER OFFICER rushes to alert steely ADMIRAL VONN.
Screen graphics show a contained blast in the powershaft.
OFFICER
Blast shields have contained the
explosion, Admiral. All systems
stable.
Vonn looks down at the glowing Kuat moon below, scoffs.
ADMIRAL VONN
Their outdated tactics are pitiful.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
Rose and Finn look up at the Orbital Ring, fully intact.
POE
Any second now.
Suddenly a high-pitched WAIL spins them around.
8.
The HOODED TUSKEN steps forward. Blades of blue light flash
from its gloved hands.
It’s holding a DUAL LIGHTSABER.
The Tusken TAKES DOWN EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH, lithe and
deadly with the blade.
Finn, Rose and Poe duck and FIRE AWAY until they are
surrounded by bodies, blasters smoking.
The Tusken’s mask hits the ground.
It’s REY.
Not the girl we last saw. A grown woman. Powerful. Strong.
FINN
What are you doing here?
Rey spins and BLOCKS A LASER BLAST we didn’t see coming. Her
robes fall from her shoulders, revealing a battle-ready
outfit of ALL BLACK.
REY
A simple “thank you” would do.
She THROWS THE DOUBLE-BLADE LIKE A BOOMERANG, ducks behind a
power regulator as the spinning saber slices all in its path,
then rises in time to CATCH IT.
This is a new weapon of her own design, made from the pieces
of Anakin’s broken lightsaber and her own staff. She wields
it with grace.
Poe ducks behind a generator, yells through lasers at Rey.
POE
You shouldn’t have come here.
REY
You’d rather be killed?
POE
If it means you’re safe, yeah.
There’s something more behind those words.
REY
Now’s not the time.
POE
Definitely not the time.
9.
She FORCE PUSHES a pack of eight, sending them clattering.
The Migrant Workers point to Rey in awe, whispering,
reverent. The children cheer, speaking a word they all know.
MIGRANT CHILDREN
Jedi! Jedi!
More Stormtroopers flood into the square--
--but the MIGRANTS BLOCK THEIR PATH TO PROTECT REY. Some
throw rocks. Others swing with hammers and tools.
It’s inspiring. A promise of revolution.
POE
Rey, we gotta go!
Rey hesitates, wanting to fight alongside these people.
REY
I have to help them!
Poe eyes more troop transports and INCOMING TIE FIGHTERS.
POE
Not here. Not now.
Rey knows he’s right, but it kills her inside. She
reluctantly follows her friends through the blast door.
Finn moves to follow them, but his ankle is grabbed by a
FALLEN STORMTROOPER, helmet blasted open.
They lock eyes. RECOGNITION. A memory from long ago.
Finn pulls free and continues on. But he’s SHAKEN.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
An Officer races to Admiral Vonn.
ADMIRAL VONN
What happened down there?
OFFICER
The last Jedi is with them, sir.
Vonn’s confidence turns to fear.
ADMIRAL VONN
Alert the Knights of Ren.
10.
EXT. POWERSHAFT CORE - DAY
Rey, Poe, Finn and Rose race toward a MAINTENANCE TURBOLIFT
that runs the length of the powershaft to the ring above.
POE
(into comm link)
BB-8 we’re coming up to you! Plan’s
gone sideways.
EXT. SPACE
BB-8 has already left the Orbital Ring in the shuttle, on his
way down to their rendezvous point on the planet’s surface,
per the plan. He BEEPS incredulously.
EXT. POWERSHAFT CORE - DAY
Poe looks up at the ring above.
POE
We’re gonna need another ship.
His eyes settle on THE ECLIPSE, a colossal star destroyer
docked just above them, an ivory pirate ship in space.
REY
You’re not serious.
FINN
That’s a Eclipse Class Dreadnaught.
You can’t fly--
POE
I can fly anything.
Rose hacks into the turbolift. The glass door opens.
ROSE
We’re in.
INT. TURBOLIFT - DAY
The door SLIDES SHUT, cutting off the sound.
ROSE
Clench. Everything.
The turbolift capsule ROCKETS UP INTO THE TUBE, traveling
from the planet’s surface to the Orbital Ring in seconds.
11.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - FUELING DOCK
The Turbolift door opens to find the stern of the Eclipse
Dreadnaught right in front of them, miles wide.
Thick fuel lines attach to the propulsion engines. GLIDE
ROVERS shuttle supplies to the ship.
REY
You sure about this?
POE
Nope.
ROSE
We had better odds on Raxus Prime.
FINN
That was not my fault, you need to
let Raxus Prime go.
They hop into a Glide Rover and SPEED OFF.
INT. OBSERVATION TOWER - DAY
Admiral Vonn watches the Glide Rover race toward the Eclipse.
ADMIRAL VONN
Where are they going?
The Glide Rover disappears inside the docked destroyer.
Admiral Vonn cracks slightly as their plan dawns on him.
ADMIRAL VONN (CONT'D)
They can’t possibly.
Admiral Vonn leans over a FIRST ORDER TECH.
ADMIRAL VONN (CONT'D)
How many men on that ship?
FIRST ORDER TECH
Just the bridge crew, sir. The rest
are on dock leave.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE
A massive navigational bridge dense with FIRST ORDER CREW.
A laser blast spins them around. Rose cocks her heavy weapon.
Finn seals the door.
12.
POE
Who’s in charge here?
DECK OFFICER
(brave)
I am.
POE
Great. I’m your new pilot.
(improvising)
Where does the pilot sit?
Rey loses patience, waves her palm toward the Officer.
REY
You will set a course for the
Nirauan System.
DECK OFFICER
Set a course for the Nirauan System!
The Crewmen turn and take their positions at the console,
mind-tricked en masse.
Poe and Rey take the helm, pressing buttons, guessing.
REY
Cold start the engines. We can jump
right to hyperspace if we overheat
the laser cannon drive.
POE
The exhaust will spill over--
REY (CONT'D)
--into the propulsion
systems. We can freeze the
chamber.
Poe looks to Rey as they flip switches, a gleam in his eye.
POE (CONT'D)
Don’t you see? You and I? How we--
REY
Not the time.
Finn sits at a massive control board with a hundred buttons.
FINN
Okay, I’m going to need very
specific instructions.
Rose goes to work at the NAV CONSOLE.
13.
ROSE
Shields up. Setting calculations
for lightspeed.
POE
Let’s go!
ROSE
Don’t rush me. I mess this up and
we’ll fly right into the sun.
Finn taps a screen in front of him. The ship’s EXTERIOR
LIGHTS click on.
FINN
I found the lights. I turned on the
lights!
One of the Crewmen SNAPS OUT OF HIS MIND TRICK, eyes Finn.
CREWMAN
Who are you--
WHACK! Finn knocks him out cold.
FINN
Let’s get somewhere else fast!
POE
Working on it...
Poe eases his hands into the steering rig.
POE (CONT'D)
Who uses an inverted control yoke?
EXT. KUAT ORBITAL - SPACE
The Eclipse roughly disengages and SCRAPES ITS WAY OUT. Fuel
conduits unhinge and SPIT BLUE ENERGY, slicing through the
dock’s infrastructure.
The ship’s exterior lights blink on and off in patch grids.
Heavy cannons FIRE on the Eclipse’s shields.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - SPACE
Poe leans back, the craft dips DOWN.
14.
REY
The black empty part is where we
should be pointed!
POE
I’m trying! Everything’s backwards!
Finn looks out the window at the planet rising into view as
they tilt further down.
FINN
(mocking)
“I can fly anything.”
Poe gains control of the craft’s trajectory but not its axis.
They are INVERTING. The planet ROLLS from the bottom of the
massive front window to the top.
REY
Okay, we’re rolling now.
POE
Do we have the droid?
EXT. SPACE
BB-8’s Maintenance craft is HIT, burning, engineless, fifty
feet from the dock. He’ll never make it.
REY (ON COMM)
BB-8 now!
BB-8 has to act.
He EJECTS HIMSELF from the droid socket, floats fifty feet
through cold empty space, passes through the oxygen shield
and LANDS INSIDE THE HANGAR with a clank.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
BB-8 BEEPS affirmative on the commlink.
REY
We got him!
Rose’s console flashes.
ROSE
Good for lightspeed!
Rey leans past Poe and SHOVES the hyperdrive helve forward.
Bars of light STRETCH OUT BEFORE THEM.
15.
EXT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - SPACE
The Eclipse blurs and VANISHES. Silence.
We TILT UP, stars raining down... WHOOMMMM. A jagged,
sinister ship appears from hyperspace.
KNIFE 9. Shaped like an arrowhead with adjustable wings. We
follow it back toward the Orbital Ring...
EXT/INT. KUAT ORBITAL - EXTERNAL LANDING AREA - SPACE
Knife 9 lands on an exposed landing pad, protected by a
quantum shield from the cold dangers of space.
The KNIGHTS OF REN appear from their ship.
HATTASKA REN, the leader, armored and caped in black. OTT REN
and LORL REN seem to work as a duo. JAEDEC REN is the rogue,
his mask evoking an angry ghost.
Hattaska eyes the scene in studied silence. He turns his
ominous, masked gaze to Admiral Vonn, here to meet him.
ADMIRAL VONN
W-we uploaded a veil cipher to the
droid. You’ll have her location the
moment a probe is within range.
Hattaska Ren draws his Darksaber AND CUTS VONN DOWN.
A few Stormtroopers instinctively raise their weapons. The
other Knights RAISE THEIR HEAVY BLASTERS.
Officers and Stormtroopers back away. Tense, afraid.
The Knights holster their weapons and return to their ship,
leaving Admiral Vonn’s body in their wake.
CUT TO:
EXT. CORUSCANT - DAY
A dense cloud layer pierced with skyscrapers.
We follow a SECURITY CRAFT down through the fog to reveal the
city, unrecognizable from its halcyon days.
New structures built atop the deco architecture of the Old
Republic, growing older as we descend to the decrepit streets
below--sedimentary layers of progress.
16.
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY
The Security Craft lands on a broad avenue rife with despair.
Immigrants from a thousand systems, all seeking a better
future for their children.
The Cruiser unloads a squad of eight Stormtroopers on
hovering NIGHTSISTER SPEEDERBIKES. They disappear down long
alleys, spreading out into the populace.
One buzzes past a dirty propaganda billboard with the
familiar First Order symbol and a message: JOIN TODAY.
Someone has painted DON’T above the JOIN.
A street kid, DADE, 12, eyes a pair of patrolling
Stormtroopers as they rough up a limbless alien.
He picks up a piece of broken cement, aims, throws. It hits
the Trooper in the head. Both spin, blasters up. But the kid
is long gone.
A BANTHA HORN sounds on high.
Dade races through plumes of smoke, past buildings with
shocks of Old Republic-era technology, revealing...
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
A massive open plaza connected by a web of boulevards. The
FIRST ORDER CAPITOL towers over it, a jagged structure
balancing on the surface like a spinning top.
Thousands are gathered here. All eyes are on a dais where
CAPITOL GUARDS hold a ragged, hooded figure before the crowd.
The people look to the sky at a HOLOGRAM OF CHANCELLOR HUX,
four stories tall. Dade weaves closer.
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM)
Today, another conspirator stands
charged with treason.
The Guards remove the conspirator’s hood, revealing BISS KOVA,
our alien on the ground from the Kuat Colony.
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
Though support for his cause has
all but vanished, let this day
remind us of the consequences for
defying our Supreme Leader.
The Capitol Guards lead Biss Kova to a guillotine with a
hissing LIGHTBLADE poised above. He stares silently ahead.
17.
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
Kylo Ren is not without pity, just
as the traitor before you is not
without remorse. And so he offers
to spare this man’s life in
exchange for the location of the
Resistance Base.
Biss Kova remains defiant. Hux’s hologram grows irritated.
BISS KOVA
Kofa rebiva tora famlia...
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM)
So be it.
Biss Kova is placed in the lightblade guillotine.
BISS KOVA
Kofa rebiva tora famlia...
Kofa rebiva tora famila...
A woman in the crowd covers Dade’s eyes. He peels her fingers
away, an anger burning within.
The lightblade FALLS.
INT. CAPITOL CORRIDOR - DAY
CHANCELLOR HUX, hair streaked with gray, looks down at the
thousands gathered in Monument Square.
The people are a distant blur from here.
Bootheels click, revealing COMMANDER SELLIK, Hux’s second in
military command.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Sir? They’re here.
INT. CAPITOL WAR ROOM - DAY
A clawed hand reaches into a silver tureen of BABY SHAAKS,
huddling together for warmth. We follow the squealing animal
into the mouth of LORD GHERLID, an alien with razor teeth.
He sits at a table of GALACTIC WARLORDS--tribal, wealthy,
coated in elaborate robes and stolen jewels.
Chancellor Hux speaks to them, nostrils flared at the smell.
18.
CHANCELLOR HUX
I assure you, the stolen Destroyer
will be found. Our probe droids are
scouring the galaxy as we speak.
LORD GHERLID
(mouth full)
A Dreadnaught class warship just
slipped through your fingers, Hux.
Your words don’t inspire confidence.
CHANCELLOR HUX
A lone signal won’t be difficult to
find. Our transmissions blockade
has silenced millions of systems.
LORD GHERLID
You can silence planets, not
people. There have been uprisings.
We must not allow the seeds of
revolution to take root.
CHANCELLOR HUX
The First Order will punish those who
defy your rule. Submit your youth for
conditioning. They will teach their
elders the rule of law.
JOR NULT, a nasty dreadlocked Weequay.
JOR NULT
It’s Skywalker they believe in, not
the law. And his apprentice, this
girl, this Jedi. She’s become a
symbol of hope.
RAYKAR SHEN, a species with curved spider fangs for teeth.
RAYKAR SHEN
The people believe she will destroy
you, Hux. And your Master.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Kylo Ren is no Master, certainly
not mine.
UGGMOT, a shapeless Noid, pounds the table with his tiny hands.
UGGMOT
(subtitles)
We must kill the last Jedi!
19.
CHANCELLOR HUX
The Knights of Ren have been
dispatched to eliminate her.
LORD GHERLID
Our fate in the hands of zealots?
You ask for our confidence, yet
provide nothing to inspire it.
Where is Kylo Ren?
CHANCELLOR HUX
The Supreme Leader will return when
he acquires the knowledge he seeks.
The warlords eye each other, not satisfied with that.
JOR NULT
When?
Hux seethes, speaking through his teeth.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Soon.
EXT. MUSTAFAR - DAY
The terrain is obsidian-like, black and reflective. Jagged
mountains spike in the distance.
A cloaked figure in tattered robes rises into frame.
KYLO REN, bearded and weary. He checks the stars for
navigation, climbs over a rock precipice...
...to reveal VADER’S ABANDONED CASTLE in the distance.
A drone droid, VX-20, floats just behind him.
KYLO
Stay here.
INT. VADER’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
A forgotten, decrepit cathedral. Crumbling. Pieces of
structure litter the ground, untouched for decades.
Kylo lights his red crossguard lightsaber, holds it up as a
torch. Tiny creatures scurry at the disturbance.
A haunting WIND blows against his cheek, chilling him.
20.
KYLO
Leave me alone.
LUKE (VO)
This is where the dark path leads.
An empty tomb.
LUKE SKYWALKER’S VOICE. Haunting his nephew like a spirit.
KYLO
And where did your path lead?
You’re a ghost.
LUKE (VO)
I know what you’re searching for,
Ben. Your Master promised you
strength, but you feel hollow.
KYLO
Soon I will be more powerful than
any Jedi. Even you.
LUKE (VO)
Are you sure?
Kylo SNAPS, spins and swings his lightsaber at empty space.
With a billow of cold wind, Luke’s spirit is GONE.
LUKE (VO) (CONT'D)
Go home, Ben...go home to Leia...
Kylo is shaken. But on the altar beyond, the artifact he came
here to find.
A SITH HOLOCRON.
He kneels before it. Holds out his palm, channels the Force.
The three sides of the pyramid pull away, revealing an energy
within. It grows in intensity and PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM.
EMPEROR PALPATINE, recorded decades ago.
EMPEROR PALPATINE (HOLOGRAM)
Lord Vader. Young Skywalker will
soon be ours, I have foreseen it.
But we must prepare for the
unforeseen. Should he strike me
down, you will take him to the
Remnicore System. There you will
find Tor Valum, Master of the Sith
Lord who instructed me.
21.
The Holocron’s blue light swirls RED. It emits a laser that
SCANS KYLO’S BODY.
EMPEROR PALPATINE (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
Here the son of Skywalker will
acquire a great ability--beyond
what you could hope to command in
your damaged state. With it, he
will harness the untapped power of
Mortis. At last we will realize--
The holocron ALARMS--Kylo Ren is not Darth Vader. Palpatine’s
image stutters.
EMPEROR PALPATINE (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
(breaking up)
-- the d-destiny...po-potential--
A blast of RED LIGHTNING shoots from the pyramidal device into
Kylo’s eyes.
The invasive pulse of energy SPREADS OVER HIS FACE like a
cancer. Horrible, raw purple veins streak through his skin.
He SCREAMS in deep, unbearable pain.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - KORILEV - DAY
A pair of blue eyes SNAP OPEN.
LEIA
Ben.
LEIA ORGANA grips a stone wall, regaining balance.
Her hair is long and grey, her robes white. A wise and
elegant leader, Leia has suffered more loss than a human can
endure. But she remains a rock in a raging river.
She stands overlooking a terrain of rainforest dusted with
crisp white snow. KORILEV, the Resistance’s secret base.
She senses a presence behind her.
LEIA (CONT'D)
Speak.
CHEWBACCA (OS)
BRWWWGGHHGHGH!!!
CHEWBACCA approaches with LT. CONNIX, wounded in battle since
we last saw her. She now has a visible scar.
22.
CONNIX
The team has returned, General.
LEIA
Mission accomplished?
CONNIX
Not exactly.
Connix nods to the sky beyond.
Leia turns to see the ECLIPSE DESTROYER descending to
planetfall over the snowy jungle, escorted by X-Wings.
They look like flies next to it.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Leia storms onto the bridge as the First Order Officers are
escorted out in handcuffs.
FIRST ORDER OFFICER
You are in strict violation of the
Corellian Accords!
POE
Yeah, put it on my tab.
Rose rips the Officer’s ID BARS off his uniform.
ROSE
You mind? I collect these.
CONNIX
What should we do with them,
General?
LEIA
Cook them dinner. They look thin.
FIRST ORDER OFFICER
The punishment for your act of
rebellion will be swift--
The doors shut in his face.
LEIA
Scan the ship. This thing could be
crawling with enemy troops.
(to Poe, speaks louder)
But our team didn’t consider that,
did they?
23.
POE
Come on, tell me you haven’t always
wanted one of these.
Leia gives him a look. Insufferable.
LEIA
Prepare for evacuation. We’re
leaving.
POE
What? Why?
LEIA
You stole a Star Destroyer.
ROSE
I disabled their homing beacon.
We’re free and clear.
LEIA
Would you bet your life on that?
That stops them both. Leia looks past them to Rey, in a
corridor off the bridge, alone.
LEIA (CONT'D)
Go.
Leia approaches Finn.
LEIA (CONT'D)
How’s she doing?
FINN
Hard to tell. Maybe you can talk to
her?
LEIA
She doesn’t need a master right now.
She needs a friend.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Finn approaches Rey, tentative.
FINN
You okay?
REY
I failed.
24.
FINN
Don’t say that. They know our
tactics. We’ve been fighting this
war for too long.
REY
Those people, the children. I saw
hope in their eyes.
FINN
They believe in you. We all do.
Those words add more weight to Rey’s heavy shoulders.
REY
I can’t be who they need me to be.
I’m not strong enough.
FINN
That’s not true.
REY
Every night I wake up screaming.
Every night, another bad dream.
FINN
Is it him?
REY
There’s something between us. I
can’t explain it.
FINN
You have to shut him out. He can’t
change, it’s too late.
REY
It’s never too late to change. You
taught me that.
Chewbacca BRAYS, excited. He’s looking out a small
rectangular porthole into the hull of the ship.
FINN
What is it, buddy?
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - WEAPONS ARSENAL - DAY
Chewie opens the blast door, revealing a mile-long arsenal of
DECOMMISSIONED IMPERIAL WEAPONRY. Ships, walkers, urban
assault vehicles, mounds of heavy artillery.
Finn’s eyes light up.
25.
FINN
This is enough firepower to take
the Capitol.
(calls out)
Poe, you need to see this!
Poe and Rose join them on the overlook. It’s a game changer.
POE
See? When have I ever come back
empty handed?
(slaps Finn’s back)
This. This was the plan.
ROSE
Was it?
FINN
We have ships. Weapons. All we need
is an army.
POE
How? Nobody can hear us. We’re in
the dark.
We push in on Rey...those words resonating with her...
REY
We don’t have to be.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY
Rey opens the ancient Jedi text from Ach-To, laid out on the
holochess table. Finn, Poe, Rose, Chewie gathered around.
REY
The Jedi had a communications
system. Before the Old Republic. It
was powered by a nexus beneath the
temple.
Sketches of a TOWER in the old Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
Light flowing from the spire into space.
REY (CONT'D)
A Force beacon, engineered to call
the outlying systems to war.
FINN
No way it still works.
26.
POE
Old Republic tech is better than
the junk we have today.
ROSE
That frequency pre-dates the Empire
by a thousand years. The First
Order’s blockade couldn’t disrupt
the signal.
FINN
It’s worth a shot.
They look to Poe. The de-facto leader.
POE
Anything’s worth a shot.
(Chewie ROARS)
Yeah, I hope so too. Rey?
Rey hesitates for a reason she doesn’t yet understand. A
dark, ominous feeling.
POE (CONT'D)
Rey.
She snaps back to them.
REY
Hope is all we have left.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - JEDI DOJO - DAY
WHACK! A wooden bo-stick hits a pillar, coughing dust.
Light pours through an open sinkhole onto an elaborate wooden
JEDI SPARRING POST. Extensions on all sides, like branches of
a tree. It MOVES--rotating at the base, limbs spinning.
Rey combats it with aggressive elegance, BLINDFOLDED. She
spins, ducks, leaps, climbing while fighting.
THUMP. A swinging post connects with Rey’s back. She hits the
ground hard, winces in pain.
LUKE’S VOICE (VO)
Your pain is an illusion.
REY
It isn’t actually.
She braces herself and ATTACKS THE POST again. A double flip
and Rey STICKS THE LANDING.
27.
But then she FALTERS. Sensing a disturbance...
EXT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT
A pair of porcine UGNAUGHTS push a levitating stretcher away
from the TIE Silencer.
On it, KYLO, in worse shape than we left him, damaged veins
stretching down his neck.
INT. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT
Kylo screams on an operating table, surrounded by MEDICAL
DROIDS. Layers of Mandalorian Iron are smelted to his face.
A discomfiting SIZZLE as they work. Kylo grits his teeth.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - JEDI DOJO - DAY
Rey touches her cheek. Feeling a sharp but distant pain.
INT. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT
Kylo screams as a jolt of electricity flows into the iron on
his face, finishing the job.
He is suddenly WRACKED BY A VISION...
A MOUNTAIN
Snow on the jagged peaks. A TEMPLE older than all known time.
AN ANCIENT CHAMBER
Two massive thrones built into the rock. A WELL OF LIGHT,
pulsing from deep below.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - JEDI DOJO - DAY
Rey is wracked by the same vision...but it continues...
A DARK FIGURE
Hooded, masked. Kylo Ren. He activates his red lightsaber,
facing off with Rey before the two thrones.
They fight, vicious, intense.
With a sharp swing Kylo STRIKES HER DOWN.
28.
BACK TO REY
She tears off the blindfold, breathless.
LUKE’S VOICE (VO)
What did you see?
REY
I saw a mountain. Two thrones in
the rock. Kylo Ren was...changed.
LUKE SKYWALKER steps into the light. A more tangible form of
Force Ghost, similar to his projected self on Crait.
LUKE
You saw the future.
REY
Kylo saw it too. I could feel him.
Like he was...there with me.
LUKE
Where?
REY
Mortis.
Luke turns grave. He sits, as Obi-Wan once sat beside him.
LUKE
What do you know of Mortis?
REY
It’s an ancient place. From a time
before the Jedi, before the Sith.
Two thrones, two powerful beings.
One of darkness, the other of
light. Together, they brought
balance.
(disbelief)
But it’s a myth.
LUKE
So was I, if you remember.
Luke is almost present now. All traces of blue light are gone.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Beneath the Temple of Mortis lies a
power beyond anything the Jedi have
ever known. If Kylo reaches the
Temple, all we’ve fought for will
be lost. You have to confront him.
29.
REY
You want me to...kill Leia’s son?
LUKE
The Force guides us toward balance.
It doesn’t always show us what we
want to see.
Rey scoffs, petulant, angry.
REY
“Balance”. Dark suffocates the
light. Light extinguishes the dark.
Over and over. How is that balance?
LUKE
I know that anger. I had it. My
father had it too.
REY
So says my master. And his master
before him. A thousand masters, so
eager to tell us how to live.
She looks through an arched opening at the Resistance Base
below. FINN AND ROSE, calibrating a grappling cannon...POE
AND CHEWIE working on the Falcon...
REY (CONT'D)
I spent my whole life wanting a
family. Now I’ve got one. I won’t
abandon them.
LUKE
The Force is speaking to you, Rey.
REY
Maybe I’m not who it thinks I am.
LUKE
Who are you?
REY
I’m no one.
LUKE
If that’s what you believe, the
last Jedi is dead.
Rey sets her practice staff alongside a line of others.
REY
Maybe he is.
30.
INT. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT
Kylo’s medical slab rises vertical. He looks into a mirror at
his altered face--half covered with smelted iron, a monster.
KYLO
Finish it.
A NEW MASK lowers onto his head and locks into place,
spitting steam. We don’t see the front of it, not yet.
A strip of glowing buttons light up the underside of his
forearm. The Med Droid presses a code. The helmet beeps.
MED DROID
Breathe.
He does. A new sound, different than Vader’s. Gutteral. Deep.
INT. CHANCELLOR HUX’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Ornate drapes and an indoor fountain. A huge throne-like
chair faces the city through a massive circular window.
Hux removes his trenchcoat, pointed hat. Catches himself in
the mirror, touches the streak of grey hair.
He peers into a glass case at an object of his affection--a
LIGHTSABER, resting on a pedestal. A collector’s item. He
gazes at it with envy.
Hux removes a few coins from his pocket. Places one on the
table. Extends his hand...
...and tries to USE THE FORCE TO MOVE IT. It doesn’t budge.
His face grows red from trying.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Nnnnnnnggghhh...
KYLO (OS)
(voice distorted)
Has all been well in my absence?
Hux STARTLES, embarrassed. Kylo’s masked face is in shadow.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Supreme Leader. You’ve returned. If
I’d known--
KYLO
I don’t need grand displays and
processions. Or titles. Chancellor.
31.
Kylo steps into the light. The new mask is reminiscent of his
first but sharper, nastier. SCARIER.
KYLO (CONT'D)
My knights tell me the girl was
within your grasp.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Apparently your knights took it
upon themselves to deal with my
General’s failure.
KYLO
And how should I address your
failure?
Hux turns whiter. Takes a small step back.
CHANCELLOR HUX
What happened to your--
KYLO
She’s beloved, isn’t she?
CHANCELLOR HUX
Belief is the solace of peasants.
The people cling to folklore, but
they fear the First Order.
KYLO
They fear ME. Soon I will command
the Force in ways unseen since the
Ancients.
CHANCELLOR HUX
The power described in the Sith
Texts. You’ve found it?
KYLO
It is within my reach. The ability
to destroy a planet will be...
insignificant.
CHANCELLOR HUX
What are your orders?
KYLO
Find the Resistance, wipe them out.
CHANCELLOR HUX
And the girl?
KYLO
Leave her to me.
32.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
A HOLOGRAM OF THE CAPITOL lights up.
Poe stands before the Resistance leadership, Leia nearby.
POE
As you know, the First Order has
silenced communication between all
neighboring systems. The source of
the blockade is a transmission
jammer deep in the First Order
Capitol on Coruscant, here.
The Capitol hologram BLINKS, zooms. A CUBE within.
POE (CONT'D)
So far we’ve been unable to find a
weakness. No thermal exhaust port,
no oscillator. In other words,
they’re onto us.
Leia smiles. He’s great.
POE (CONT'D)
Our forces are too depleted to
mount a direct assault, but we’ve
found an alternative.
The Capitol hologram dissipates to make way for a new
structure: THE JEDI TEMPLE, a familiar five-spired building.
POE (CONT'D)
An analog system, from the days of
the Old Republic.
Schematics of an ANCIENT MACHINE, powered by Kyber crystal.
POE (CONT'D)
A small team will activate the beacon
and summon the galaxy to war.
The hologram demonstrates--a light SHOOTS FROM THE CENTER
SPIRE and connects fifty other planets like dots.
POE (CONT'D)
When they succeed...the rest of us
will be ready.
Finn steps forward, eyes alive.
FINN
I’ll lead the team, General.
33.
ROSE
I’ll lead the team, General. But
I’ll let him think he’s doing it.
Leia eyes Rey, sensing her conflict.
LEIA
Rey?
REY
They’re looking for me, it’s
dangerous enough as it is.
(conflicted)
I can’t go with you.
Poe’s smile fades. Leia doesn’t press it, reading the room.
LEIA
Prepare to evacuate. We’ll
reconvene at the rendezvous point.
ON R2-D2 AND C-3PO
on the edges of the room. R2 BEEPS.
C-3PO
Coruscant? Finally a good idea from
those scrambled circuits of yours.
Coruscant will be quite pleasant
this time of year.
R2 garbles and rolls off. C-3PO follows.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Yes, a properly refined city will
be welcome after hoveling down here
like a Gundark.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Poe catches up with Rey.
POE
Hey. What was that about?
REY
I have to bring an end to all this.
I have to confront him.
POE
Mmmhmm. You’re just gonna “confront
him”? Who talks like that?
34.
REY
Jedi do. I’m new to this.
POE
Okay, I’m going with you.
REY
No. I have to go alone.
POE
Is that in your book too? Where is
this confrontation going to happen?
REY
Mortis. In the unknown regions.
POE
Mortis is a myth.
REY
It isn’t. I saw it.
POE
Oh you saw it. And how do plan on
finding it?
Rey hesitates, unsure.
REY
I’ll...figure it out.
She walks away. Poe follows, determined.
POE
Hey. Look, I know you think
I’m wasted air on any
mission, Master Jedi--
REY (CONT'D)
Please stop calling me that.
POE (CONT'D)
--but the thing is, I know
someone who can find the
system you’re looking for.
REY (CONT'D)
If it’s one of your Flight
Academy friends, I swear--
POE (CONT'D)
It’s not one of those guys.
But those guys are great.
REY (CONT'D)
--because they are unreliable
at best. And I am being nice.
POE (CONT'D)
She’s a navigator, lives on
Bonadan. Force sensitive, like you.
(off her look)
Not exactly like you. Spice diggers
used to pay her to find deposits on
asteroids.
35.
REY
Do you trust her?
POE
She’s a little off, but if this
place exists, she can find it.
Rey softens. Poe is standing closer than he’s ever been.
POE (CONT'D)
Hey. I get it. No attachments, Jedi
path, I’ve read that story too.
But...
(catches himself)
I’m just saying you don’t have to
do this alone.
ON LEIA
Through layers of pilots, notices Rey and Poe in the
corridor. Recognizes the romantic tension.
Her knowing look quickly turns to concern.
ON POE AND ROSE
Finn tightens a bolt on the grappling cannon. A loud CLANK
startles him. He closes his eyes, left hand shaking.
ROSE
Hey. It’s okay.
Finn’s past has followed him for years. Memories of friends
kidnapped and conditioned to serve.
FINN
One of the Stormtroopers on Kuat. I
knew him. We trained together, when
we were kids. He looked so scared.
I remember that feeling.
ROSE
I don’t think that feeling ever
goes away.
FINN
I can’t let more of them end up
like me. It has to stop.
Rose puts a calming hand on his. He breathes easier.
ROSE
That’s what we’re fighting for.
36.
INT. KYLO REN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Kylo gazes down at Darth Vader’s burned mask, speaking once
more to the grandfather he never knew.
KYLO
I understand you now. Your
weakness. Your pain. You allowed
love to cloud your judgement. I
will succeed where you failed.
He grips Vader’s mask and exits onto his balcony.
A thousand feet up, a layer of clouds below, stars above.
Kylo holds Vader’s mask out over the edge...
...and lets it go. It plunges below the clouds and SHATTERS.
INT. TIE SILENCER - NIGHT
Kylo Ren lowers into the cockpit. His drone, VX-20, settles
into the data dock over his right shoulder.
KYLO
(amplified, distorted)
Set a course for Remnicore.
VX-20 beeps in affirmation.
INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT
Hux watches Kylo’s TIE Silencer fly into the starfield above.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Goodbye Ren.
Commander Sellik approaches.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Sir, one of our probes picked up the
droid’s signal. We’ve found them.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Ready my ship, I want to witness
their extinction myself.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Shall I inform the Supreme Leader?
37.
CHANCELLOR HUX
No. Let Kylo and the girl fulfill
the empty promises of their ancient
religion. In the end they’ll
destroy each other, as Jedi and
Sith always have. Then we will
rise. Strong, decisive. Ready to
bring true order to the galaxy.
Commander Sellik eyes Hux, unnerved by him.
CHANCELLOR HUX (CONT'D)
Prepare the attack.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - SPACECRAFT HANGAR - DAY
Buzzing energy as the Resistance evacuates the base. Poe and
Chewbacca load up the Millennium Falcon.
POE
Because I’m not sending her out
there alone, that’s why.
(BRAAGGGHH!!!)
Will you trust me?
Nearby, Rose and Finn load up the PHANTOM HAWK, her junky but
reliable ship, pieced together from parts.
Rose has the hood open, tinkering with the innards.
ROSE
This is a Corellian hyperdrive. R2,
do we have a keycode for this?
R2-D2 projects a hologram of KEYCODES. Finds a match.
ROSE (CONT'D)
This is every hyperdrive key in the
old Imperial fleet. They still use
these. R2, where’d you get this?
R2-D2 beeps.
C-3PO
I told you to erase the data from
Bespin’s central computer. You
don’t know where it’s been.
Finn looks past the droids to REY, loading up the Falcon with
Poe and Chewie. He approaches her.
FINN
Guess this is goodbye.
38.
REY
Don’t say that.
FINN
You’ve come a long way since Jakku.
REY
So have you.
(eyes the Resistance)
They trust you. They should.
Finn and Rey HUG. They say nothing, but it means everything.
Poe appears, BB-8 rolling alongside him.
POE
We should get outta here before--
(awkward intrusion)
Oh, I uh --
Finn pulls Poe in strongly and hugs him.
FINN
(to Rey)
Take care of him.
REY
I will.
Finn swallows his emotion and forces himself away to the
Phantom Hawk, where Rose sweats under the engine bay.
ROSE
No, hop onboard, relax. I’ll handle
all of this...work.
Rey watches Finn board the ship. Nothing but love for her friend.
Beyond the Phantom Hawk, Leia approaches.
REY
Leia. I...
LEIA
You don’t have to say it.
Right. Force-sensitive.
REY
I can save your son.
LEIA
I believed that once, like you.
39.
REY
There’s good in him.
LEIA
There’s good in all of us. But the
boy I knew is gone.
(a heartbreaking beat)
Rey, be careful.
REY
Master Luke trained me well.
LEIA
Some things you can’t train for.
Rey follows Leia’s eyes to POE, caught staring at her just as
Chewbacca tosses him a wrench.
REY
I don’t-- What?
LEIA
Come on. I know how complicated
this is.
REY
I can’t. There are rules. Jedi
rules.
LEIA
(scoffs)
Written by who? Some old man, a
thousand years before you were born.
Leia speaks to Rey like her own daughter.
LEIA (CONT'D)
My whole life, I heard one word.
Balance. I never really understood
what it meant. Until the first time
I saw you. I heard that word again.
Like it was whispered to me.
Balance.
Leia takes her hand. Intimate. Close.
LEIA (CONT'D)
You’re not like my father. Or my
brother. You’re new. Whatever
happens, remember: the Force chose
you, Rey. Your story isn’t written
by anyone else.
40.
BOOOOOMMMM. A massive blast shakes the mountain. Dust
crumbles, alarms blare. Massive blips on radar screens.
RESISTANCE TECH
Resurgent Class Star Destroyer
detected, we’re taking fire!
EXT. SPACE - KORILEV ORBIT
The Finalizer bears down on the planet while two other FIRST
ORDER STARSHIPS arrive from lightspeed, flanking it.
INT. FINALIZER DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Hux looks out at the glowing planet beyond.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Decimate any ships leaving the
planet!
(to Weapons Op)
Charge the primary weapon!
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - SPACECRAFT HANGAR - DAY
BOOOOOM!! Alarm lights FLASH. Pilots run for their ships.
COMMAND INTERCOM (VO)
Emergency evac. All personnel and
craft to Rendezvous Point Crimson.
RESISTANCE GUARDS surround Leia.
LEIA
Route all unarmored transports to
the Eclipse, it’s our only way out.
Leia locks eyes with Rey as she goes.
POE
Rey! We have to go!
(she’s focused on Leia)
Rey!
Rey races up the Falcon ramp. Poe yells to Finn.
POE (CONT'D)
Go! Get out of here!
Finn and Rose hurry into the Phantom Hawk.
41.
Transports and fighters fly out of the hangar toward the
waiting Eclipse, hidden in a deep canyon.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Rey and Poe instinctively spin into the pilot seats. Chewie
doesn’t like it. He ROARS.
POE
I know, I know. Your seat.
Chewie bangs the walls. That’s his damn chair.
REY
(flipping switches)
Can we talk about this later?
INT. PHANTOM HAWK - DAY
Rose reverses their ship out of the hangar. Another BLAST
from the Star Destroyer pulses the shields.
C-3PO
I’m afraid our shields cannot
withstand a superlaser of this
magnitude--
ROSE
Tell me the odds, Threepio. I like
numbers.
Finn watches the Millennium Falcon rise out of the sinkhole.
FINN
Good luck, Rey.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Rey answers Finn as if he’s next to her.
REY
(to Finn)
You too.
The Falcon rises out of the deep sinkhole to the surface,
where the jungle is ON FIRE. Laser blasts pound the mountain
base from above, relentless.
Just inside the shield barrier, transports and fighters fly
into the open docking bays of the Eclipse Destroyer, like
bees into a hive, safe inside.
42.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Leia takes her command position on the bridge, now fully
manned by Resistance personnel.
CONNIX
Shields are at eight percent,
General. We can’t wait any longer.
She takes one last look at Korilev. Another home taken from her.
INT. FINALIZER DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Hux’s pale face glows from superlaser fire.
WEAPONS OPERATOR
Primary weapon charged, sir.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Fire!
INT. PHANTOM HAWK - SPACE
Finn and Rose feel the heat of the explosion all around them
as the light bends ahead and they ESCAPE INTO HYPERSPACE.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Leia closes her eyes, feeling the loss of the men and women
left behind as the Eclipse MAKES THE JUMP TO LIGHTSPEED.
EXT. KORILEV - DAY
The Eclipse VANISHES in an instant.
The Finalizer’s superlaser finally cracks the shields. The
base ERUPTS.
The entire planet EXPLODES IN HELLFIRE. From the ring of
destruction, the Millennium Falcon rockets out into space.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SPACE
The ship RATTLES. Mountainous chunks of space rock spin away
from the exploded planet, creating a field of obstacles all
around them. Chewbacca WHINES.
43.
POE
I know!
(to Rey)
We can’t make the jump with all
this debris.
REY
Neither can that Destroyer.
POE
Chewie, cloak our signal!
BOOOOOOMMMM! The Falcon quakes. Damage alarms blare.
They swerve and dodge through chunks of destroyed planet--
some pieces still intact with mountains, jungle valleys and
waterfalls frozen by the cold of space.
A familiar ship enters frame in blazing pursuit.
The dark and jagged KNIFE 9.
INT. KNIFE 9 - COCKPIT
Jaedec Ren at the helm. Ott and Lorl flank him in elevated
gunchairs. In the deep background, Hattaska floats in an
electro-oxygen chamber, tubes weaving around his body.
Ott and Lorl unload waves of targeted blasts on the Falcon,
exploding remnants of planet when they miss the ship.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
BOOM!! The Falcon is hammered with laser fire. Relentless.
POE
Who’s this?
Rey eyes the pursuing ship on the rearview graphic monitor.
REY
Let me fly.
POE
I’ve got the yoke. My yoke!
REY
My SHIP!
Chewie ROARS. Both wrong.
44.
EXT. PLANET DEBRIS FIELD - SPACE
Knife 9 pursues the Falcon through the spinning pieces of
Korilev, trying to avoid collision without losing the target.
The Falcon gets close to one of the planetary fragments and
buzzes the surface, dodging blasts as it flies UP THE FACE OF
A FROSTED JUNGLE MOUNTAIN IN SPACE.
The horizon spins as the fragment spirals above both ships,
spinning out on its chaotic trajectory--suddenly the mountain
is inverted above them with the blackness of space below.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
Poe fires on the jagged mountain peak, hanging above them now
like a stalactite.
The mountain peak blasts apart, sending projectiles spinning
into the path of the pursuing craft.
Knife 9 is HIT by a sharp piece of rocky mountaintop, sending
it wildly off course.
REY
We’re clear!
POE
Punch it!
Light bends ahead and they ROCKET INTO HYPERSPACE.
INT. KNIFE 9 - COCKPIT
Alarms blare as they spin out. Jaedec Ren regains control,
righting the ship. The Falcon is gone.
Jaedec approaches the electro-oxygen chamber, eyeing Hattaska
through the glass. Wires protrude from his mask into the main
computer. He’s in some kind of induced sleep.
JAEDEC REN
What do you see, brother?
Jaedec places hand on the glass. Suddenly Hattaska does the
same, hand flat on the glass against Jaedec’s.
Lorl and Ott look on, waiting for the answer. Jaedec’s head
tilts up. He nods, removes his hand from the glass.
JAEDEC REN (CONT'D)
Set a course for Bonadan.
45.
EXT. REMNICORE - NIGHT
Kylo’s TIE Silencer enters the atmosphere of a cold black
planet veined with silver.
It touches down on a ridge overlooking a wide valley of
obsidian-like terrain. Frozen trees in windswept shapes.
Floes of white lava.
EXT. REMNICORE FORTRESS - NIGHT
Kylo approaches an ancient stone military battlement consumed
by time. Skeletons of fallen WAR BEASTS litter the terrain.
Whatever battle happened here, it ended centuries ago.
He passes empty suits of armor. Robes draped over broken
shields. Flags flutter in the wind.
A Sith helmet on the ground, skull visible within. A reminder
that while the Jedi live on, the Sith become dust.
His tracking beacon flashes a single red dot.
Lifeform detected.
INT. REMNICORE FORTRESS - COURTYARD - NIGHT
The door OPENS TOWARD US, revealing Kylo, hand extended.
He enters a circular chamber stacked with broken spacecraft
parts, ancient military technology and piles of silver ore. A
glowing white fire crackles in a stone pit.
A voice WHISPERS as he draws closer to the flame.
TOR VALUM (OS)
Reveal yourself.
Kylo’s lightsaber IGNITES. A reflex action.
KYLO
I seek the Sith Master Tor Valum.
TOR VALUM (OS)
I am no master.
The mountain of junk MOVES. From it, as if disguised within,
comes TOR VALUM, 7000-years-old, an alien of unknown origin.
Spindly and tense, sinew and muscle pulled tight.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
But I was once called Tor Valum.
46.
Kylo remains steadfast. Dominant.
KYLO
You trained Darth Plagueis?
TOR VALUM
That name means nothing to me.
Kylo’s lightsaber FLASHES in anger, settling inches from Tor
Valum’s taut, leathery skin.
KYLO
Does your life?
Tor Valum regards Kylo, smiles with sharp teeth.
TOR VALUM
You threaten me with death. How
amusing.
KYLO
You are weak. I feel nothing.
TOR VALUM
You feel what I allow you to feel.
Child.
The creature extends a long finger. Pointing to Kylo’s mask.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
Reveal yourself.
Kylo removes his mask. His face is veined, corrupted worse
than we remember. Tor Valum appears oddly entertained.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
Mmmmm. You wish to obtain the power
of those who came before. Take your
place among the Gods of Mortis.
KYLO
I do.
TOR VALUM
To rule the galaxy without armies,
without starships.
KYLO
Yes.
TOR VALUM
Yet you fear the frailty of your
vessel. You need this power.
47.
Kylo’s jaw tenses. He nods.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
Kneel before me.
Miraculously, Kylo KNEELS.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
You call yourself a Sith. But the
Sith are unrepentant, remorseless.
You’re haunted by the past, your
very existence.
KYLO
I have no regrets.
TOR VALUM
You lie. Until you sever yourself
from the past, your fate will be
the same as theirs.
Tor Valum motions to the battlefield in the valley below.
Empty JEDI KNIGHT ARMOR. Vacant SITH MARAUDER ARMOR beside
it. Withered husks of animals and men.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
The Living Force is nourishment.
The more one consumes, the stronger
one becomes. To take life...is to
cheat death.
The creature lifts his body with his arms and WALKS ON THEM.
Kylo eyes his strange new master.
KYLO
Teach me.
CUT TO:
EXT. BONADAN - SUNSET
The Falcon descends into a valley of cylindrical mountains
rising over water spotted with junk boats. This planet exists
in permanent sunset, lit by its bustling NIGHTMARKETS.
The Falcon lands on a multi-leveled DOCKING ARRAY. It feels
like a tower of lilypads, a visiting ship on each.
48.
EXT. BONADAN - DOCKING ARRAY - SUNSET
Poe argues with two stumpy Langoles, OKE and SOKKO, at the
base of the Millennium Falcon’s ramp.
POE
I know it’s a Corellian light
freighter but you’re gonna say it’s
a Praddor Cruiser in the registry.
That’s why I winked when I gave you
the money. Understand what’s
happening here?
Oke and Sokko CHATTER in their alien language, voices rising.
POE (CONT'D)
Okay, which one of you is in charge
because you’re both the size of
children where I come from.
Rey exits the Falcon. Poe stops her.
POE (CONT'D)
Whoa, whoa. You can’t go out like
that. You look like a
(low)
Jedi.
REY
What’s that supposed to mean?
POE
Just tone it down a little.
(to Chewie)
Chewie, will you straighten these
guys out?
Chewbacca takes over negotiations with the Langoles.
The landing pads ROTATE AND DESCEND, lowering the Falcon’s
platform to water level. An elegant and fluid system.
Poe leads Rey toward a TOOTHLESS MERCHANT selling jewelry and
sari-like robes.
POE (CONT'D)
How much for this one?
Rey takes out her credits. The Merchant shakes her head,
closes Rey’s hand around the money.
REY
Thank you.
49.
BRAAAGGGHH!! Chewbacca has one of the Langoles lifted off the
ground, using him as a bargaining chip against the other one.
POE
Aw, Chewie! Negotiate. Persuade,
quietly.
Chewbacca shakes his head and WHINES: I am.
EXT. BONADAN NIGHTMARKET - SUNSET
Rey and Poe step off a junk boat ferry into a sensory
overload of lights, smells and tastes.
Aliens and humans haggle over prices of artisan crafts and
live animals. Packs of teenagers eat bizarre street food from
market stalls. Kids laugh at buskers and street performers.
A FREAK SHOW HAWKER beckons them to a curtained booth.
HAWKER
Come witness the frothing eye of
Loyyil Karn!
They walk among the oddities and wonders, undercover. Rey’s
colorful sari gives her an exotic elegance we’ve never seen.
She uncomfortably adjusts her incognito hooded pullover.
POE
I like it. You look like a local.
REY
You’ve been here before?
POE
With my grandfather. I used to
sail, right out there. You’ve never
seen so many lights.
He eyes her.
POE (CONT'D)
What do you remember?
Rey digs for a memory before her abandonment.
REY
My father and I would build
starships out of wood. They could
fit in your hand.
50.
POE
Anything else?
REY
I remember love. That’s why I
waited for so long.
(doubt creeps in)
But I must have imagined it. They
were no one.
Poe looks at her in the setting sunlight. Wishing he could
change the past for her, but unable.
POE
No one is no one.
Rey takes that in. Then she spots a trio of MECHTROOPERS
scanning the crowd ahead.
Poe follows her eyes, puts his hand on his blaster.
REY
No.
She pulls Poe into a market stall, eyeing them through
hanging cloth. An old, female UTAI PEDDLER barks at them to
taste the spicy clawfish soup she’s selling.
UTAI PEDDLER
Cassasan! Nep. Nep.
POE
No. Not hungry.
She holds out the steaming ladle to Poe, encouraging.
UTAI PEDDLER
(offended)
Depee casssasan!
One of the Mechtroopers looks in their direction.
POE
Okay. Here. Just shh.
Poe drinks from the soup ladle.
REY
Mmm. See? Mmmm.
His face turns red. He COUGHS from the intense heat. The Utai
and her friends LAUGH.
51.
UTAI PEDDLER
Arno tow di?
POE
No, it’s good.
He coughs harder, getting worse. The Mechtrooper moves in
their direction, hearing the violent coughing...
Rey grabs Poe by the shirt and pulls him into a KISS, hiding
his face behind her headscarf.
The Mechtrooper sees the two lovers from afar while the Utai
women applaud in the background. He moves on.
Rey and Poe pull apart. He takes a moment to recover. He’s
never kissed a Jedi.
REY
Did it work?
POE
I mean, I think so.
Rey looks past him at the Mechtroopers walking away.
POE (CONT'D)
Oh. So that wasn’t--
REY
(lying)
No.
They eye each other, wishing the Force could stop time.
REY (CONT'D)
We should--
POE
Right. Yeah.
INT. BONADAN - NAVIGATOR’S DEN
A circular room draped with colorful silks. Devoted FOLLOWERS
sit around the edges, smoking all manner of pipes and
vaporizer devices. An ELECTROHARPIST plays ethereal music.
NOMI, a tiny alien child who appears no older than 5, sits on
a pillow at the center of a floor made of marbles.
She consults quietly with an ALIEN COUPLE on the brink of
divorce. They cry, touching foreheads.
52.
Rey and Poe enter through hanging beads.
POE
Easy on the details. She doesn’t
have to know who or why. Just what.
Nomi senses Rey and smiles past the couple in front of her.
NOMI
A Jedi. The last.
All eyes turn to Poe and Rey.
POE
Or this. We can do it this way.
Nomi nods to the couple before her, touching their chests.
NOMI
Go.
(to Rey)
Come. Sit. The Jedi and the man.
Conspiratorial asides in the gallery. Rey and Poe walk
barefoot over the marbles fitted into the stone floor.
NOMI (CONT'D)
You seek a place.
REY
A planet.
NOMI
Mortis is the place.
REY
Yes, I saw it in --
NOMI
The mouth on the Jedi stops and the
mind makes the picture. The Force
fills the Jedi and reveals the
destination.
Poe nods encouragingly. Rey closes her eyes and breathes.
The tiny marbles in the floor RISE INTO THE AIR, taking the
three-dimensional shape of the galaxy all around them.
NOMI (CONT'D)
The destination is very old. The
first to know the Force. The first
where the good was done. And the
evil too.
53.
Rey opens her eyes, surrounded by FLOATING MARBLES.
REY
Which one?
NOMI
The destination lies within.
POE
Look, we’re in a hurry--
NOMI
The man will not speak.
The marbles swirl above Rey, a galaxy around her.
NOMI (CONT'D)
The eyes close. Only the Jedi knows
the path...
Nomi’s voice grows distant as Rey falls deep into meditation.
FLASH TO:
MORTIS
Snow on the peak. Autumn leaves in the valley below.
NOMI (VO) (CONT'D)
There the two will meet. Drawn
together by the Force.
THE TEMPLE
Two thrones in the rock. A well of light, pulsing from deep
within the mountain below.
NOMI (VO) (CONT'D)
The dark side and the light.
A CLOAKED FIGURE
Standing before Rey. His mask unmistakable.
NOMI (VO) (CONT'D)
There she will make the sacrifice.
THE FLASH OF A RED LIGHTSABER
Jarring, violent as Kylo Ren STRIKES REY DOWN.
Rey SNAPS OUT OF HER VISION.
54.
POE
Wait, what?
A flat black oval stone at the center of the marble array
falls from orbit into Nomi’s palm.
POE (CONT'D)
What do you mean, sacrifice?
She hands it to a rabbit-sized astroscrivener, GEB, seated at
a tiny easel. He paints a starmap of the chosen location.
NOMI
The Jedi must go alone.
POE
No, hold on a second.
Geb the Astroscrivener tears the drawn planetary map off his
easel, limps to Rey and hands it over.
REY
Thank you.
POE
We’re not leaving. What did she
see?
(to Rey)
What did you see?
NOMI
The Jedi will make the journey. The
journey will answer the question.
POE
What question? Can we all just take
a deep breath and talk about this.
Rey stops at the door.
REY
Is there another path?
Nomi looks at Rey with wide, unreadable eyes.
NOMI
There is always another path.
EXT. CORUSCANT - NIGHT
Rose’s Phantom Hawk descends through the skyscraper canyons.
The city plunges underground below them, dense and alive,
like roots of a tree.
55.
INT. PHANTOM HAWK - NIGHT
Finn and Rose observe through the cockpit panel.
FINN
So many people living underground.
ROSE
Rich folks don’t spend much time
thinking about what they’re
standing on.
Finn eyes the darkened JEDI TEMPLE in the distance.
FINN
That’s it. Drop R2 and Threepio at
street level.
C-3PO
I’m afraid all my knowledge of
Coruscant is limited to the upper
levels.
R2-D2 BEEPS.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Elitist? Where do you even learn
these words?
EXT. CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The Phantom Hawk rises from the streets, leaving R2 and C-3PO
behind. The ship ascends on the darkened roof of a skyscraper
in skeletal stage, lights off.
INT. ABANDONED SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT
An unfinished floor, beams and girders only. Rose and Finn
open a case, fold out their GRAPPLING CANNON.
THUNK! THUNK! Rose bolts the gun into the concrete floor.
Finn attaches a sniper scope to the muzzle of the cannon.
Aims at the top of the JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE a quarter-mile away.
FINN
Ready?
The grappling cannon FIRES. Sticks. They harness in.
56.
ROSE
You don’t have a fear of heights,
do you?
FINN
It’s not the height I’m afraid of,
it’s hitting the ground.
ROSE
So you’ll be fine if we don’t fall.
They unlatch and ZIPLINE A THOUSAND FEET above the city.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
Finn and Rose crash through the shattered window and
unbuckle. The chamber is barely recognizable, long forgotten.
FINN
(into comm)
R2, you have that message ready?
EXT. JEDI TEMPLE COURTYARD - NIGHT
R2-D2 beeps, leading C-3PO through the decrepit courtyard at
the base of the temple. A sad reminder of a better time.
C-3PO
This doesn’t look like the Jedi
Temple to me.
They move past oil drum fires and covetous looks from the
city’s DWELLERS, the poorest of the poor.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
What do you mean I stand out?
(R2 beeps)
Gold is not ostentatious. Leave the
vocabulary to me you glorified
mechanic.
A VAGABOND ALIEN steps in front of Threepio. Several others
appear from behind, rubbing their hands across his wares.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Excuse me! Oh my.
A STROBE LIGHT blinds them.
STORMTROOPER VOICE
Get away from that droid!
57.
The dwellers scatter. The strobe shuts off, revealing the
light and the audio recording came from R2-D2.
C-3PO
Thank goodness. Don’t ever leave me
again.
R2-D2 leads them through a crumbled wall inside the temple,
revealing the GRAND ENTRANCE HALL--gothic arched ceilings
over a massive Kyber Crystal mounted like a holy sculpture.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
Rose and Finn run their fingers along the smooth walls. Rose
finds a pyramid-shaped socket.
FINN
Found one.
Finn finds another identical panel across the room. He
unwraps a pair of CRYSTALS. Throws her one.
ROSE
No!
She CATCHES IT.
ROSE (CONT'D)
Five thousand year old Kyber crystal.
Very rare. You hand it to me.
FINN
Sorry.
They insert their crystals into the sockets.
FINN (CONT'D)
Ready? Three two...
CLICK. The spire RUMBLES. The floor opens. A HUGE COPPER
MACHINE rises up, Old Republic tech around a central
conducting chamber. Power flows through it, humming. Grand.
Then it SHORTS OUT, sparks fall. The machine goes dark.
ROSE
Can’t it be easy? Just one time.
58.
EXT. REMNICORE - NIGHT
A three-tusked GRONK BOAR squeals, struggling to run in
place. The animal’s eyes roll back as the Living Force is
drained into Kylo’s open hand, reducing it to a husk.
Kylo opens his eyes. His face has more life, his eyes
brighter, scars receded. Empowered. Grateful.
Tor Valum smiles like a parent who just taught his child to
ride a bicycle.
KYLO
More.
TOR VALUM
There is no more. You have consumed
all that remains.
A wind cuts from an ice cave beyond. A faint glow within.
KYLO
What’s down there?
TOR VALUM
A vergence.
KYLO
I can feel it.
TOR VALUM
There is more within. Go.
Kylo puts on his mask and enters.
INT. VERGENCE CAVE - NIGHT
The light from Kylo’s red saber refracts in the vast walls.
The cave is empty. But not silent.
There is a sound from the darkness. BREATHING.
From the shadows comes the hulking presence of DARTH VADER.
Kylo stands his ground, lightsaber up, unsure what is
happening. Vader ignites his own weapon, swings...
Kylo BLOCKS. Vader strikes again, forcing the descendant of
Skywalker to defend himself.
It’s a brutal fight. Intense lightsaber combat between two
iconic villains.
59.
But Kylo is no match. Vader STRIKES HIM DOWN. He screams in
pain, falls to the ground.
Kylo struggles to remove his mask. Breathless. Looks down at
his chest wound. It no longer exists.
He is alone.
EXT. REMNICORE - NIGHT
Kylo staggers from the cave. Angry, disoriented.
KYLO
Where is Mortis?
TOR VALUM
The well of the Living Force. The
source of the galaxy’s birth.
KYLO
I want to be stronger than those
who came before. Where is it?
Kylo’s eyes are alive. Hungry.
TOR VALUM
You are not worthy of its power.
Not yet.
Kylo reaches out his arm and FORCE HOLDS Tor Valum, delving
deep into his mind...
KYLO
Where is Mortis?
Tor Valum’s smile goes away. He grits his teeth, pained as
Kylo probes and extracts.
TOR VALUM
Release me.
KYLO
I see it.
TOR VALUM
Betrayer...I gave you knowledge...
KYLO
A mountain in winter. No, fall.
TOR VALUM
I gave you everything...
60.
KYLO
I know. You’ve given me so much.
The light of the Living Force drains from Tor Valum into
Kylo’s open hand.
KYLO (CONT'D)
Thank you.
The ancient being falls dead, reduced to a withered shell.
EXT. BONADAN - OUTSIDE NAVIGATOR’S HUT - NIGHT
Rey COLLAPSES, a powerful disturbance coursing through her.
POE
What is it?
REY
He’s growing stronger.
Poe looks around the market, as if Kylo is nearby.
REY (CONT'D)
We don’t have much time.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
Sparks fly as Rose welds the broken conductor into place.
FINN
Will this old thing work with
modern droids?
ROSE
You’re asking me about the mechanics
of a Force-powered antenna.
FINN
Out of your realm of expertise?
ROSE
Out of anyone’s realm of expertise.
She closes the panel, flips a rusted lever. Silence.
FINN
So is there like an “on” button, or--
THMMMM. A light IGNITES within the machine.
61.
ROSE
Listen, if this goes sideways-- I
just want to say--
FINN
Say what?
A column of light SHOOTS down the hollow spire.
INT. TEMPLE SPIRE BASE - NIGHT
C-3PO lurches as the ground VIBRATES. The column of light
from the spire above connects with the Kyber crystal below.
It GLOWS.
R2-D2 wheels next to the column of light and projects a
HOLOGRAM MESSAGE directly into the datastream.
EXT. CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The light beam shoots up into the sky, visible for miles.
The poor and downtrodden look up at the beacon, faces warmed
by its light. Among them, Dade smiles, hopeful.
EXT. DEEP SPACE
The LIGHT leaves Coruscant and connects to a nearby planet.
EXT. AGORA SIX - DAY
Hills rise above a dense layer of palm jungle. Atop one, a
THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD RECEIVER from the Old Republic. The light
hits the receiver, disappearing within.
INT. AGORA SIX RECEIVER - DAY
An old copper machine consumes the light. The gears spin and
whirl. Monitors come to life with ARABESH CODE.
An ancient BENDU MONK rises to his feet, looks to the sky.
He’s been waiting for this a long time.
Lights blink and flash as the machine decodes the datastream
back into an image: LEIA, elegant in her white robes.
62.
EXT. AGORA SIX - SETTLEMENT - DAY
PEASANTS in a bread line look up at the light hitting the
receiver in the distance.
Suddenly a nearby R4 Unit droid beeps wildly and PROJECTS THE
HOLOGRAM OF LEIA.
LEIA
(hologram)
This is General Leia Organa of the
Resistance...
The Receiver sends another BEAM OF LIGHT from its core,
angled on a different trajectory into the sky.
EXT. DEEP SPACE
The beacon of light leaves the Agora system and connects to
WAVETT, a light blue planet further into space.
EXT. WAVETT - SHIPYARD - DAY
WORKERS look up as the light hits a Receiver perched on a
cliff overlooking the ocean.
Suddenly every DROID in the yard simultaneously PROJECTS the
hologram message from Leia.
LEIA
(hologram)
The time has come to forge a path
to freedom.
INT. MON CALA - FISH BAR - DAY
MON CALAMARI pause to listen to the hologram emanating from
several droid servers inside the floating eatery.
LEIA
(hologram)
The forces of oppression have ruled
our galaxy for too long.
EXT. GRIA - DAY
A village of floating straw huts on water. The light hits a
man-made STONE TOWER on the horizon.
63.
LEIA
(hologram)
We must join together and fight.
Send your fastest ships...
EXT. BOTHAWUI CITY - DAY
Muscular canine BOTHANS look up.
LEIA
(hologram)
All your warriors...
INT. TRANDOSHA PALACE - NIGHT
BOSSK, sitting like a sultan in his den of pleasures, turns
angrily toward the hologram projected from his SERVANT DROID.
LEIA
(hologram)
Our voices will not be silenced.
Bossk looks out his window at the light connecting to a red
rock spire in the distance. He clenches his fist.
EXT. TATOOINE - MOISTURE FARM - DAY
Setting suns against a BOY and his SISTER at the base of a
vaporator tower watching their R6 unit play the hologram.
LEIA
(hologram)
We can no longer live in the shadow
of the First Order.
EXT. BONADAN MARKET - SUNSET
Rey and Poe step through a dense, captivated crowd as droids
project the end of the message.
LEIA
(hologram)
We must step into the light.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE
Leia stands on the bridge, watching the light connecting
planets. A familiar group of Resistance fighters join her,
their eyes wide and hopeful.
64.
EXT. REMNICORE TUNDRA - NIGHT
As he approaches his ship, Kylo Ren feels the light in the
sky. It’s visible in the stars above.
He moves to a rocky overlook. Closes his eyes, concentrates.
Holds out his hand.
The rocks around him VIBRATE. Deep.
The light in the sky HALTS. Stopped by an immoveable force.
EXT. SPACE
The light is frozen in place like a suspended laser blast,
thrumming as pressure builds.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
The beam grows in intensity. The receiver QUAKES.
ROSE
Something’s wrong.
FINN
Go. GO.
Rose and Finn dive away as the ancient device EXPLODES.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE
The light GOES DARK, the fire of revolution extinguished.
Leia is overcome with an ominous feeling of loss.
EXT. BONADAN NIGHTMARKET - SUNSET
The holograms DISAPPEAR. Rey’s hope turns to alarm.
REY
We have to get to the ship.
POE
What is it?
Rey is already moving, pushing through the crowd.
65.
INT. TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
Rose and Finn climb from the rubble, coughing on dust.
ROSE
You okay?
They are suddenly SURROUNDED BY A TRIO OF TIE FIGHTERS, laser
cannons aimed through the open arched windows.
FINN
Come on!
Finn clips onto the zip wire. Rose grabs on. They zip away
from the tower as the Temple Spire EXPLODES behind them.
In the courtyard below, R2-D2 and C-3PO hurry out of the
collapsing temple, swallowed by a cloud of dust.
EXT. ABOVE CORUSCANT - NIGHT
Finn and Rose escape the fireball, but the TIE Fighters turn
and PURSUE THEM, blasting away.
Rose draws her weapon and shoots at the enemy ships in
midair. She shatters the front windshield of one, hitting the
pilot. It spins out and CRASHES.
Rose is grazed by a laser blast. She screams in pain.
The zipline SNAPS as the temple spire CRUMBLES. Rose FALLS
INTO DARKNESS.
FINN
Rose!!
Finn swings into open floor of the unfinished skyscraper.
Struggles to unhook himself.
The TIE Fighters hover around the skeletal structure on
either side and FIRE INTO IT. Finn runs for his life as the
blasts ricochet off steel girders all around him.
He slides into a stairwell under heavy fire.
EXT. BONADAN NIGHTMARKET - SUNSET
Rey crumbles, emotional, feeling Finn’s pain.
REY
Finn...
66.
She looks up at Poe, the crushing feeling of loss growing
heavier. But Poe is looking at something behind her.
HATTASKA REN, through the separating crowd.
OTT AND LORL REN on either side, menacing amidst the carnival
lights and box lanterns.
Rey rises, backing away from the oncoming Knights of Ren.
POE
Okay I’m with you. We gotta get to
the ship.
She reaches for her lightsaber...
POE (CONT'D)
Not here.
Rey eyes the children and peasants in the market. Poe’s
right, they can’t take more casualties.
Rey clenches her fist and FORCE PUSHES EVERYTHING AROUND HER--
a powerful concussion blast that knocks everything away,
including Poe.
He flies off the edge of the market wall and plunges into the
water below.
Rey jumps onto the dock, and unhooks a RAZORSAIL, powered by
a Dyson-like air cannon.
REY
Get on!
Poe swims to the boat’s ladder.
POE
Can you sail?
Rey channels the Force and FILLS THE SAIL with a gust of wind
that launches them into the bay.
EXT. BONADAN BAY - SUNSET
Poe and Rey speed across the bay toward the landing array.
This boat is VERY FAST.
Something fires from above, exploding the water all around.
Rey looks up.
Knife 9 SPEEDS OVER THE WATER TOWARD THEM.
67.
POE
Get to the bow cannon. I’ll drive.
Poe takes the helm while Rey activates the laser harpoon
mounted on the front.
She BLASTS AWAY at Knife 9 while Poe steers them toward the
Falcon’s docking array.
INT. KNIFE 9
Hattaska Ren pilots with cold precision. Jaedec, Ott and Lorl
sit in surrounding cockpit chairs.
EXT. BONADAN BAY - SUNSET
The Razorsail now takes fire from all sides. Rey thinks fast,
turns the harpoon and SHOOTS THE SAIL CORD.
She reaches out to Poe.
REY
Hold on!
Poe joins her and holds on tight.
The disconnected sail lifts them up like parasailers onto the
first revolving landing pad of the docking array.
The Razorsail hits the shore and EXPLODES.
Knife 9 banks away from the explosion, but turns right
around. They’re not done yet.
EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - SUNSET
Chewbacca is waiting by the ship.
POE
Chewie, we drew some attention!
An adjacent landing pad lowers into view.
Knife 9 rests on it. The four Knights of Ren stand ominously
out front, their platform rising even with the Falcon’s.
Rey activates her lightsaber.
REY
Stand back.
68.
Rey leaps onto their landing pad and takes them on, spinning
and striking fast, outmatched but relentless.
Poe and Chewbacca unload their blasters at Jaedec, who
deflects with skill while firing a pistol with one free hand.
Rey fights Hattaska--lightsaber vs darksaber--then FORCE
PUSHES him off the edge of the landing array. He falls fifty
feet to the next pad below.
Ott and Lorl stay on her, moving in coordination, an unseen
hive communication keeping their deadly attacks in sync.
Poe and Chewie can’t get a shot in on Jaedec--his blaster
fires FAST, fully-automatic.
Poe is GRAZED, he screams in pain.
ON REY AND THE KNIGHTS
Rey hears Poe’s scream. It brings RAGE. She kicks Lorl away,
buying a moment of one-on-one with Ott.
She slices through him, dropping him cold. Then she spins on
Lorl, reaches out...
...and FORCE PULLS HIM INTO HER LIGHTSABER, impaling him.
A ghostly screech as Hattaska RETURNS, swinging wildly.
Rey disconnects her double saber and BLOCKS HIS STRIKE--one
saber blade still impaled in Lorl’s chest, the other clenched
with Hattaska.
BENEATH THE FALCON
Chewbacca peppers Jaedec Ren with bowcaster fire. Jaedec
struggles to deflect the shots while Chewbacca advances.
He reaches Jaedec, grabs him by the neck and HURLS him off
the landing pad.
Then he lifts his bowcaster and FIRES, hitting Jaedec in
midair like a clay pigeon.
HATTASKA STRIKES AT REY
Brutal swings, his darksaber sparking when it hits the
concrete. He grazes her. She drops her lightsaber and falls
back. Unarmed.
69.
Hattaska stands over her. Raises his darksaber for the kill.
When he does, Rey gets a good look at his MASK...
FORCEBACK TO:
Dark figures in the rain. Voices SCREAMING.
Lightning flashes, revealing HATTASKA REN.
BACK TO:
EXT. BONADAN DOCKING ARRAY - SUNSET
This vision stirs a deep, vengeful ANGER in Rey. One she
can’t yet explain but knows to be true.
Hattaska brings his saber down...but she extends her good
hand, teeth clenched, eyes burning.
PURPLE FORCE LIGHTNING flows from her fingertips.
Hattaska Ren’s skull flashes within his helmet as the
electricity destroys him.
The body falls, smoking.
Rey rises. Poe and Chewbacca are watching her, disturbed.
REY
I- I had no choice.
POE
It’s okay. Jedi do that. Right?
REY
I’ve seen that mask before. All of
them.
Poe and Chewie head for the Falcon...but Rey does not follow.
POE
Rey, let’s go.
REY
No. You can’t go where I’m going.
POE
What are you talking about? This
was the plan.
REY
The Resistance needs you. Finn and
Rose need you.
70.
POE
Rey. Get on the ship. Please.
REY
You have to leave this place.
POE
I’m not leaving you.
Rey knows what she has to do. Hates it.
REY
You will leave this place and go
back to help the Resistance.
POE
I’m not...don’t do this...
She approaches Poe. Delicately brushes her fingertips over
his bleeding forehead.
REY
You will leave this place and go
back to help the Resistance.
Chewbacca HOWLS.
POE
No...you can’t...
Poe feels his mind slipping away from him.
REY
You will leave this place and go
back to help the Resistance.
Rey takes Poe’s face in her hands and KISSES HIM.
When she pulls away, Poe looks distraught. Saddened.
POE
I...I have to leave this place. I
have to help the Resistance.
Poe turns and walks up the ramp. Chewbacca follows. BB-8
looks up at Rey, ever faithful. She’s purposefully cold.
REY
Go!
BB-8 BEEPS mournfully and follows them onboard.
Rey watches as the Falcon’s ramp RISES, obscuring Poe and
Chewbacca from her sight.
71.
Strangely, as it closes, Poe holds up a hand goodbye. His
sentience breaking through the mind trick.
The Falcon rises into the sky, Rey’s sari robes whipping in
the wind.
INT. KNIFE 9 - SUNSET
Rey enters the cockpit. Places Nomi’s hand-drawn map on the
console. Rests her lightsaber on top of it.
Her left hand is cut and bleeding. She wraps it with the sash
from her sari, then removes the civilian robes to reveal the
black warrior’s clothing beneath.
She catches her reflection in the mirror.
A Jedi.
EXT. BONADAN - LANDING ARRAY - SUNSET
Knife 9 rises into the air and rockets into space.
INT. TIE SILENCER - NIGHT
Kylo Ren leaves Remnicore’s orbit, mask off.
A holocom transmission from Hux appears on his dash.
CHANCELLOR HUX
(holocom)
Supreme Leader. The Resistance
attempted to override the
communications blockade.
KYLO
Do you really not know who stopped
them?
Hux’s face betrays him. He didn’t know.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Such treachery cannot stand. We
must respond swiftly.
KYLO
Our Empire is strong. Show them.
72.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Your absence emboldens them. If
you’ve acquired the power you seek,
show it.
KYLO
Snoke was right about you, Hux.
Without faith, you serve only
yourself.
Kylo shuts the holocom off. Sets new coordinates manually.
BLASTS INTO LIGHTSPEED.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia looks out at the blue swirl of hyperspace.
CONNIX
(distant)
General...
(clear, present)
General? We’re approaching the
rendezvous point.
Leia makes a decision.
LEIA
Prepare an Imperial shuttle. I’ll
need a valid code clearance.
CONNIX
But we’re light years from--
(gets the look)
Yes, General.
Connix exits, leaving Leia alone. She removes the General’s
bars from her robes, pulls a hood over her head.
LUKE (VO)
He’s in pain.
She responds to Luke as if he speaks to her often.
LEIA
I feel it too.
Luke’s Force Ghost steps forward, at her side.
LUKE
He’ll soon be more powerful than
our father.
73.
LEIA
So will she.
LUKE
She feels too much. Love. Anger.
LEIA
Don’t we all?
LUKE
This is why the Jedi live in
isolation. The pain of loss only
leads to the Dark Side.
LEIA
I’ve lost everything, and everyone.
But I’d still choose to love.
Leia regards her brother. Missing him.
LEIA (CONT'D)
Trust her instincts. She may not
follow the path of the Jedi, but
she’s our only hope.
EXT. CORUSCANT - UNDERGROUND - NIGHT
Finn sneaks out of the skyscraper, bleeding, disoriented.
Voices echo, flashlights searching for him, bearings lost.
Down the alley, Stormtroopers on AT-LT’s--single-rider
walkers--scan the dark with flood lights.
A small light up ahead. He ducks into shadow.
A Stormtrooper, RK-514, approaches, scanning the tunnel with
his blaster-mounted flashlight.
Finn appears behind him, shoves a handheld device in the back
of his neck and STUNS HIM.
The Stormtrooper collapses. Finn confiscates his weapon and
holds him at blaster-point.
FINN
Look at me.
The Stormtrooper moans, half-conscious.
FINN (CONT'D)
Take off your helmet.
74.
The Trooper follows the order. His eyes are scared,
disillusioned. Vulnerable.
FINN (CONT'D)
What do you remember? How far back?
RK-514
Huh?
FINN
Do you remember when you were
taken? Remember your parents?
RK-514
I. I don’t know.
FINN
Yeah you do. You remember
everything. Conditioning camp.
Blind fires.
RK-514
It was t-training.
FINN
That’s what they tell you.
Finn’s face finds the light. RK-514 recognizes him.
RK-514
You’re him. The traitor.
FINN
That’s right. We’re brothers. All
of us.
Finn tosses the Stormtrooper’s helmet out of reach.
FINN (CONT'D)
Give me your comm link.
RK-514 hands him his First Order comm.
FINN (CONT'D)
It’s not what they said it would
be, is it? The things we’re ordered
to do. It’s not right.
RK-514 takes that in. Torn. Breaking.
FINN (CONT'D)
You had a name once. Do you
remember it?
75.
He shakes his head no.
FINN (CONT'D)
Get a name. That’s the first step.
Finn shoulders RK-514’s blaster and kicks open a sewer grate.
RK-514
Then what?
FINN
Find something worth fighting for.
Finn DROPS into the dark sewer, leaving RK-514 changed.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - INQUISITION CHAMBER - DAY
Chancellor Hux stands over a prisoner strapped to a vertical
torture rack. Rose.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Are you comfortable?
ROSE
Yeah, I have one of these at home.
CHANCELLOR HUX
You changed the stolen Destroyer’s
signature codes so we couldn’t
trace it. Give me the new codes.
ROSE
You know, they told me to pick
something easy to remember, like
Life Day but...
CHANCELLOR HUX
You think this is funny. Very well.
Hux holds out his hand. Shuts his eyes, concentrating deep.
ROSE
Are you? Are you trying to use the
Force on me?
CHANCELLOR HUX
Be quiet.
ROSE
Oh no, see...you’re not special. I
mean, at all.
76.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Shut up!
He calms his fury, restraining himself.
CHANCELLOR HUX (CONT'D)
We have other ways to extract
information.
Hux opens a blast door to reveal an ELECTRIC TORTURE DEVICE.
New tech, built to work quickly.
Rose braces for a more painful kind of defiance.
CUT TO:
EXT. OLLAFORN - DAWN
Leia’s shuttle descends among plumes of earth-hued steam
shooting up like skyscrapers from surface cracks.
ALIENS soak in sulfur baths, sweating from the steam.
INT. OLLAFORN VILLAGE STREET - DAY
A trio of drunken FIRST ORDER OFFICERS stumble down a side
street on leave. Two hold up the blitzed third, singing.
FIRST ORDER OFFICER
Sing it how my mother sang it!
A white-robed figure walks past them. We glimpse LEIA’S face
as she maneuvers through the enemy’s midst.
She eyes an unmarked door lit by a single lamp. When the
coast is clear, she heads in.
INT. OLLFORN CABARET CLUB - DAY
Classy, smoke-filled. Lampshades on every table. No customers
left, only ALIEN SERVERS cleaning up and cashing out.
A slovenly BAND MANAGER divides up credits between a pair of
quad-armed XEXTOS at the two pianos on stage.
The Servers leave their night’s take to be counted by the
owner, LANDO CALRISSIAN, 70, smooth as ever.
Leia’s shadow falls over the pile of credits.
77.
LEIA
A man in his element.
Lando looks up, smiles big.
LANDO
Leia.
Lando is quickly on his feet, brings her hand to his lips.
LEIA
Alright, alright.
The band manager eyes them from the stage.
LANDO
You shouldn’t be seen here.
LEIA
For your sake or mine?
LANDO
Both.
INT. OLLAFORN CABARET CLUB - PRIVATE LOUNGE - DAY
Lando pours a warm cup of tea.
LANDO
The clientele are mostly First
Order, but what can I do? The grip
of this Empire is tighter than the
last. Smuggling’s a matter of life
and death.
LEIA
I need your help.
LANDO
(wary)
Leia...
LEIA
We need ships. Pilots. You know
every smuggler in the galaxy--
LANDO
Look, I promised Han I’d take care
of you if something happened--
LEIA
Oh you’d take care of me?
78.
LANDO
I know, you deserve better. But
helping your new friends crash into
the First Order’s machine isn’t
what he would’ve wanted.
LEIA
Lando, the galaxy needs you.
Lando eyes something of concern on the cabaret floor. A trio
of STORMTROOPERS talking to that skeezy Band Manager. They
look up in Lando’s direction.
He takes Leia’s hand and heads for a private elevator.
LANDO
Remind me never to make promises.
INT. OLLAFORN - DOCKING BAY - SPACE
Lando brings Leia to her shuttle ready for departure.
LANDO
You need to go. I can’t protect you
here.
LEIA
Come with me. Fight with us.
LANDO
We won a war once already, what
good did that do?
LEIA
We proved it could be done.
LANDO
Leia. I’d do anything for you.
Lando puts a loving hand on Leia’s cheek. Leans forward and
kisses her tenderly on the forehead.
LANDO (CONT'D)
I’m sorry.
IN THE SHUTTLE
Leia watches Lando grow small as the shuttle flies away, his
cape dusting behind him.
LEIA
Rey. Help us.
79.
EXT. DEEP SPACE - DAY
Rey drops out of lightspeed to find herself in swirling
clouds, half red, half blue. An ominous and violent
atmosphere surrounding a black circle.
The Galactic Void.
Suddenly the navigational equipment blinks out. The ship
rattles. Alarms sound.
Rey braces herself, re-calculates for lightspeed and MAKES
THE JUMP INTO THE VOID.
The stars streak into infinite straight lines ahead, then
TWIST AND BEND as she passes through the black hole.
Rey’s face becomes a echo of itself, in fifteen places at
once, like the mirrorcave on Ahch-To.
NEARLY-SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS:
--Finn taking her hand on Jakku.
--Han Solo handing her a blaster on Takodana.
--Kylo reaching into her mind on Starkiller Base.
--Leia smiling fondly on her return to D’Quar.
--Luke taking the lightsaber on Ahch-To.
--Snoke snarling at her in the moments before his death.
--Poe yelling out her name on Bonadan.
--Hattaska Ren’s Force-electrified mask.
...until it all STOPS.
Rey opens her eyes. There is a planet ahead. No stars visible
around it, only deep black.
Heavy clouds swirl over one third. Another third is a rich
green. Another orange and red.
Suddenly the power DROPS OUT. Lights on the dashboard go
dark. The ship goes into free fall.
EXT. MORTIS - WESTERN WOODS - DAY
Knife 9 skims over treetops and CRASH LANDS in a riverbed.
Tiny fish leap out of the water and run away.
80.
Rey pries herself out of the wreckage and sloshes to land.
She looks back at the smoking ship. No turning back.
She hikes into the leafy forest, SUMMER TURNING TO FALL at an
accelerated pace around her.
The trees clear to a steep ledge. A towering mountain ahead.
A TEMPLE barely visible at the summit. The valley below is
alive with autumnal oranges, yellows and reds.
She journeys on.
EXT. MORTIS - EASTERN PLATEAU - DAY
Kylo’s Silencer lands in a clearing of dead trees. No leaves
on the branches, covered in snow.
He looks up at the mountain ahead. Visibility is low.
A NATURAL STONE BRIDGE over a deep precipice. Tall granite on
either side, vaguely shaped into primitive faces.
It feels like a gate.
A WHISPER ON THE WIND swirls around him, fluttering his cape
in the air. The Force is strong here.
He journeys on.
CUT TO:
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAWN
Empty. Silent.
R2-D2 and C-3PO emerges from an abandoned building. Two small
figures swallowed by the desolate urban landscape. R2 BEEPS.
C-3PO
I agree, R2. We may not survive
this time.
A shadow falls over them both. A battalion of FIRST ORDER
TRANSPORTS descend through the morning mist.
They touch down, releasing an army of BRUTETROOPERS.
Thick, muscular mercenary enforcers, chrome armor and masks,
reminiscent of Phasma. These guys make the Stormtroopers look
like the neighborhood watch.
81.
INT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAWN
The Brutetroopers bark orders, flashing lights and weapons as
families are forced from their homes.
A horrified, waist-high CHADRA-FAN begs for mercy.
CHADRA-FAN
Beeeeek! Beeeek naaat!
A Brutetrooper shoves his rifle into the alien’s stomach,
doubling him over. A trio of infants WAIL from their perch on
the ceiling.
A few nearby Stormtroopers look at one another, disturbed by
the violence. Next-level vicious.
The Brutetroopers push frightened citizens into prison
crafts. Children are separated from their parents, herded
into transports en route to the conditioning camps.
They scream, reaching through steel bars as the crafts RISE.
R2-D2 and C-3PO watch in horror as it plays out around them.
C-3PO
I can’t watch. How horrible.
R2 beeps, melancholy.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
We’ll never find Master Finn now.
INT. SEWER UNDERGROUND - DAY
Sludge water spurts out of multiple chutes into a gelatinous
sewer cake of repulsive, mysterious contents.
Finn JETS out of a chute and SPLASHES DOWN, sputtering.
FINN
Ughh.
A pack of SEWER WOMP RATS feed on the refuse encased in the
gelatinous mass. One approaches and sniffs, hideous whiskers
brushing his face.
Finn tries to dislodge his arms from the gel.
FINN (CONT'D)
Hey! Get away! Ugghgh!
82.
It takes a lick of his face before he can pull an arm out and
SWAT it away. The womp rats SCATTER.
Then he sees why the rats scattered.
The colossal GRYOCK, a white eyeless larva the width of the
tunnel it’s emerging from. It feeds on the sewage, gaping
mouth slowly sucking the gelatinous mass into its body.
FINN (CONT'D)
Oh no. No, no no!
Finn dislodges himself enough to get stuck again. The Gryock
closes in, slow as the sludge he’s stuck in. This is the
worst of bad nightmares.
The Gryock’s jaws open, dripping saliva, teeth like knives...
Just as Finn is about to get eaten by this thing, a hatch
above him OPENS, pouring light.
It’s DADE.
DADE
Give me your hand!
Finn grabs the kid’s hand and pulls himself up into the hatch
just as the Gryock CHOMPS down.
INT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
Finn collapses, shaking, traumatized for life.
FINN
That was. So many disgusting
things. All at once.
DADE
I’ve seen worse.
(offers a hand)
Dade.
FINN
Just one name?
DADE
What’s wrong with that, Finn?
FINN
You know me.
83.
DADE
We’ve been tracking you since you
landed.
FINN
We?
A distant SCREECHING sound.
FINN (CONT'D)
What was that?
DADE
You don’t want to find out. Come
on.
Dade shows Finn his RESISTANCE RING.
DADE (CONT'D)
Trust me.
EXT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - DAY
Finn follows Dade down a tight tunnel, boots splashing in the
shallow water. Light up ahead.
DADE
First Order purged a ten mile
radius around the Capitol after the
galaxy went dark. Took most able
bodies to the conditioning camps.
FINN
Did anyone escape?
DADE
Just us.
Dade opens a rusty door to reveal...
INT. ABANDONED UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY
Hundreds of compartment-like dwelling units connected by
catwalks to a central control tower.
Living here, a thousand escaped citizens, aged 12 to 60. Finn
is stunned.
FINN
How many people are down here?
84.
DADE
Ten thousand. Maybe more.
FINN
You have weapons?
DADE
Whole city’s got weapons. That’s
what they’re afraid of. A million
of us rise up, the First Order’s
finished.
Finn lets that idea burrow deep.
FINN
You’re right.
He’s caught up, fervent, brave.
FINN (CONT'D)
This revolution starts here. Right
now.
DADE
Sure. All we need is ships,
weapons. An army.
Finn looks out at the massive underground cavern of humanity.
A thousand faces. Waiting for a leader.
FINN
We have one.
Finn eyes the old prison Command Tower in the center.
INT. PRISON COMMAND TOWER - DAY
Finn kicks open the door and fires up the comm system. He
looks out at the downtrodden faces.
FINN
My name is Finn. I bring a message
from the Resistance.
An OLDER WOMAN exits her cell. Tired and worn, kept down by
this war since the Rebel Alliance days.
FINN (CONT'D)
The First Order rules by fear. They
build ships to intimidate us. Wear
masks to frighten us. But they’re
the ones who are scared.
85.
The Older Woman takes her wooden spoon and RAPS IT
rhythmically against the bars of the old prison.
FINN (CONT'D)
This is not the time to hide
underground. If we take the
Capitol, the galaxy will join us!
An ALIEN joins. Then another.
FINN (CONT'D)
Together we can strike back!
Together we can resist!
Hundreds, then thousands of people CLANKING THEIR POSSESSIONS
TOGETHER IN UNISON.
Finn stands tall. From traitor to deserter to revolutionary
leader--his journey has led to this.
EXT. MORTIS - WESTERN CLIFFS - DAY
Rey scales the icy peak, blasted by wind and sleet. She
reaches a plateau, finds her footing.
There are statues of ROBED ANCIENTS here. Not Jedi.
A STORM OF SNOWDUST obscures her vision. Voices ECHO.
Suddenly she’s back in the bright, warm sands of
THE JAKKU DESERT
Wind sweeps over the dunes. A child’s voice screams out.
Through the storm of sand, a little girl is dragged away from
her MOTHER and FATHER.
It’s YOUNG REY at the moment her parents abandoned her. The
little girl screams, reaching out her hand.
YOUNG REY
Come back! Wait!
Rey steps toward them, feet digging in the sand.
REY
Wait...
The Mother breaks from the Father’s grasp and runs toward
Young Rey, but the Father holds her back.
86.
FATHER
No! We can’t! It’s too dangerous!
The Mother relents. Calls to her daughter. Heartbroken.
MOTHER
Stay here! Wait for us! We’ll come
back. Understand? I promise we’ll
come back.
Young Rey SCREAMS.
Rey’s watery eyes match her younger self as the ship rises,
casting a shadow over them both.
The sandstorm kicks up, obscuring them. It turns from yellow
sand to SNOW.
Rey catches her breath, devastated.
REY
They were afraid. Why were they
afraid?
No response. Only wind.
REY (CONT'D)
Luke! Tell me! Why were they
afraid?
He doesn’t answer. She grows furious. SCREAMS. Her lightsaber
flashes as she CUTS AN ANCIENT STATUE IN HALF.
It falls, cracks in half.
She looks up at the Temple above, anger burning in her eyes.
EXT. MORTIS - EASTERN FOREST - DAY
Kylo hikes through winter. Glimpses of the Temple break
through the canopy above.
Suddenly the wind dies. There’s something ahead.
A HOUSE IN THE WOODS. Smoke from the chimney.
His younger self, BEN SOLO, approaches the house. He wears
all black robes. A hood.
This is clearly some kind of Force-induced vision, a sign of
this planet’s strength.
Kylo watches from the shadows as Ben nears the house.
87.
When he puts his hand on the iron door handle, it opens.
HAN SOLO stands in the doorway. He looks at his son with
sadness and fear.
HAN SOLO
What are you doing, Ben?
BEN
That’s not my name anymore.
HAN SOLO
You’re mother can’t see you here.
Not like that.
Ben pulls his hood down. He’s maybe seventeen.
BEN
I’m not coming back. There’s a
greater destiny for me.
HAN SOLO
They’re lies, son. Empty promises.
You have everything you need right
here.
BEN
What, you? Her? My Master says I
have unequaled power. Neither of
you understand.
HAN SOLO
Your mother understands more than
anyone.
BEN
She sent me away.
HAN SOLO
To learn. To grow.
BEN
I have grown.
Kylo watches Han approach his son, strikingly similar to
their confrontation on the catwalk on Starkiller Base.
HAN SOLO
Your mother loves you.
BEN
She’s afraid of me.
Han eyes the lightsaber in Kylo’s hand.
88.
HAN SOLO
Give me the lightsaber, son.
Han reaches for the lightsaber.
BEN
You know I can’t.
ON THE STARKILLER BASE CATWALK
Kylo is back in the moments just before he killed his father.
He watches as he plunges the blade through Han Solo, his
father’s eyes full of love even as the life drains from him.
IN THE MORTIS EASTERN FOREST
Kylo, disturbed and shaken, alone again in the snow.
Determined, he takes his first steps up the mountain.
CUT TO:
EXT. CORUSCANT STREETS - DAWN
Empty. Silent.
R2-D2 and C-3PO emerge from a side street. Two small figures
swallowed by the desolate urban landscape. R2 BEEPS.
C-3PO
I agree. This isn’t the Coruscant I
remember.
A shadow falls over them both.
A towering AT-MT WALKER rounds onto the boulevard. They watch
it pass, dwarfed by it.
It stops--a smoking, charred FIRST ORDER TANK in its path.
C-3PO and R2-D2 look on, curious.
INT. AT-MT WALKER - COCKPIT - DAY
The AT-MT PILOTS look down at the burning tank.
AT-MT PILOT
Any life forms?
AT-MT COPILOT
Nope.
89.
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - SIMULTANEOUS
Finn and a hundred PEOPLE’S RESISTANCE FIGHTERS hunker down
inside this empty building. The AT-MT’s head is positioned
just below them outside.
FINN
Now.
Floor-mounted GRAPPLING GUNS fire hooks that STICK into the
opposite building, creating several ziplines over the AT-MT.
Finn clips on a carabiner...
EXT. CORUSCANT STREETS - DAY
Twenty Resistance fighters SWING ONTO THE AT-MT LIKE PIRATES
BOARDING A SHIP.
Finn drops onto the top of the AT-MT’s body. Dozens more land
beside him. They run along its back to the head.
A Resistance Fighter cuts through the hatch with a vibrasaw.
Finn tosses a shock detonator inside.
FINN
Clear!
An electric FLASH within. The Pilots slump over the controls.
Finn drops in, pushes the Pilots aside, takes the helm.
A familiar alien, SIX-EYES, takes the co-pilot seat.
FINN (CONT'D)
Load up!
The side panels of the Walker slide open, allowing the
Resistance fighters to rappel into the cavity.
More armed citizens pour out of the alleys to escort the
steel beast as it WALKS DOWN THE BOULEVARD, knocking aside
the flipped tank as it passes.
A pair of TIE CHOPPERS zip around the corner and square off
against the AT-MT.
The Walker BLASTS THEM OUT OF THE SKY.
90.
INT. CAPITOL - INQUISITION CHAMBER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Hux paces. In the next room, Rose SCREAMS IN PAIN between
electric jabs and shocks.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Chancellor. There’s been an
insurrection. Word has spread to
other districts.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Decimate them.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Sir...the leader is a former FN
unit. He was aided by a regiment of
our own.
Hux twitches.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Impossible.
COMMANDER SELLIK
We’re dispatching additional units
to address the revolt.
CHANCELLOR HUX
NO. No. Recall the FN units from
active duty.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Sir?
CHANCELLOR HUX
If there is a flaw in their
programming, we must correct it.
Deploy more Brutetroopers.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Those mercenaries are
undisciplined. And expensive.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Perhaps money is all that inspires
loyalty anymore. Do it.
INT. CAPITOL - INTERROGATION CHAMBER - DAY
Rose’s eyes are sunken, clothes ripped, blood peeking through
the torn fabric. She hears COMMOTION, the barking of orders.
Two Officers enter, in a hurry.
91.
FIRST ORDER OFFICERS
Transfer to cell block 6. They want
her in maxiumum security.
One officer releases her from the rack. She slumps forward,
dead weight. They drag her toward the door.
As they move, Rose opens her eyes, eyeing the electric taser
on the Officer’s hilt.
When they reach the door she HITS THE LIGHTS.
She grabs the taser, shocks them both. Clamps both their
wrists to the iron shackles.
ROSE
So long, boys.
Rose shuts the door behind her, leaving the two unconscious
Officers in here alone.
EXT. IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY
The AT-MT turns the corner onto Imperial Boulevard.
Inside, Finn stokes revolt via loudspeaker.
FINN
(into comm)
We will no longer live in silence!
Gather your weapons! Rise up!
Strike back!
Finn squints out the window at a GOLD DROID wandering among
the cheering revolutionaries, unsure how he got here.
FINN (CONT'D)
Threepio?
Finn climbs out of the AT-MT hatch for a better look.
Suddenly he’s YANKED UPWARDS. A BRUTEROOPER lifts him out of
the hatch and THROWS HIM ONTO THE BACK OF THE WALKER.
Finn is locked in a FISTFIGHT on the back of a moving Walker,
50 feet off the ground.
Finn takes BRUTAL HITS from the Brutetrooper’s steel gloves--
it’s like fighting a medieval knight with his bare hands.
A powerful TACKLE and they BOTH ROLL OFF THE EDGE OF THE
MOVING WALKER...
92.
...SLAM! They land on the Brutetrooper’s back. He KEEPS
FIGHTING, unharmed.
Finn spots the Walker’s foot coming down on them, they ROLL
AWAY just as it lands.
The Brutetrooper grabs a fallen blaster, puts a heavy foot on
his chest, aims for Finn’s heart.
BRUTETROOPER
Last words, FN-2187?
Suddenly laser fire TAKES HIM OUT.
Finn looks up...at a UNIT OF STORMTROOPERS.
The leader takes off his helmet, extends his hand.
It’s RK-514.
He lifts Finn to his feet. Hands him a blaster.
RK-514
Rafe.
FINN
I like it.
The other Stormtroopers take off their helmets and throw them
aside. Diverse faces with a new purpose.
Freedom.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE - SPACE
Connix escorts Leia to a terminal.
CONNIX
The message is from an First Order
transmitter. Finn is alive.
He has an army ready to storm the
Capitol. They need reinforcements.
LEIA
All we have is what’s on this ship.
You can’t win a war with a hundred
pilots.
POE
Plus one.
Chewbacca GROWLS.
93.
POE (CONT'D)
Sorry, plus two.
BB-8 beeps.
POE (CONT'D)
Okay, I get it.
Leia’s face falls from relief to dread.
LEIA
Where’s Rey?
POE
She went on alone. Her choice, not
mine. What about the others?
LEIA
We lost contact with Rose.
(BB-8 beeps sadly)
Finn is alive. He says he has an
army on the ground.
POE
Then we put our pilots in the sky
and back him up.
(off her look)
What? This is what we’ve been
waiting for. If we take the
Capitol, we can destroy that jammer
and call the galaxy to war.
LEIA
They’ll kill millions. I’ve seen
it. It’s too reckless.
POE
Resistance is reckless! Passion is
the greatest weapon we have!
Poe appeals to Leia. Their history together laid bare.
POE (CONT'D)
The Rebels fought the Empire and
won. You showed us it could be
done. But that was your war. This
one’s ours. Let us fight it.
Leia looks out at the Resistance Fleet. Young. Ready.
LEIA
Set a course for Coruscant. Ready
all weapons and attack ships. This
is a full assault.
94.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - DOCKING BAY - SPACE
Resistance Soldiers load into transports. Pilots lower their
droids into place.
URBAN ASSAULT VEHICLES roll into the open cargo holds of
massive heavy transports.
EXT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - SPACE
The Eclipse tacks toward a distant point. The hyperdrive
FIRES, rocketing the massive craft deep into space.
CUT TO:
EXT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - DAY
Kylo Ren ascends the steps to a sealed stone door.
The Temple is cut into the mountaintop. Uninterpretable
carvings, runes and statues allude to civilization and
knowledge long lost.
He reaches out. The door bends to his will and OPENS. A
millennium of dust spills from its cracks.
But he does not enter. He knows he’s not alone.
KYLO
I knew you’d come.
Kylo turns to face REY.
His mask surprises her. She’s only seen the projection of his
ideal self in their connections. Not this.
KYLO (CONT'D)
The Force is strong in this place.
Can you feel it?
A low RUMBLE. She’s digging into his mind.
REY
You’re in pain. Beneath that mask.
KYLO
Get out of my head. You won’t like
what you find.
He FORCE-PUSHES HER BACK. Her feet slide back a few inches,
but she withstands it, steadfast.
95.
KYLO (CONT'D)
I’m stronger than Anakin Skywalker.
Stronger than his son.
REY
But you’re still afraid.
KYLO
Of what? You?
REY
Of what you’ve become. The Dark
Side has left you empty. Alone.
KYLO
I don’t have to be alone. With the
power of this place, we could rule
the galaxy as the Ancients did. The
Dark Side and the Light.
REY
You still think I’d join you. After
what you did to my family?
Kylo falters a bit.
REY (CONT'D)
We’re you going to tell me here?
Weaken me with the truth? I know
what you did. Deep down, I’ve
always known.
She circles him like a lion.
REY (CONT'D)
My parents didn’t sell me for
drinking money. They were hiding me
from you.
KYLO
So you remember.
FLASH TO
The Knights of Ren in the rain--the image from Rey’s Force
vision when she first touched the lightsaber.
A distant child SCREAMS.
KYLO (CONT'D)
Snoke made his orders clear. Find
anyone who could destroy him. It
didn’t take us long to find you.
96.
REY
You killed my parents.
KYLO
You blame me for your life on
Jakku. You should thank me for it.
You were safe.
REY
Say it! Did you kill them?
KYLO
I did.
A blast of powerful energy EXPLODES AROUND HER, clearing the
temple mount of loose rocks.
REY
You murdered Han Solo...
KYLO
I’m not here for you, Rey.
REY
Millions of people...
KYLO
All I want is behind that door.
Rey IGNITES HER DUAL-LIGHTSABER.
REY
Then you’ll have to kill me.
Kylo lights his own saber.
KYLO
I know.
Kylo ATTACKS. They CLASH on the steps of the Temple. Both far
more powerful than the last time they met.
One of these two will not survive.
CUT TO:
EXT. CORUSCANT - SPACE
The Eclipse appears from lightspeed. The city glows beneath.
First Order SENTINEL SHIPS protect the Capitol from space.

INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia spins around in the chair once occupied by Ackbar.
LEIA
Send the fleet to planetfall. Surprise
is the only advantage we have.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - DOCKING BAY - SPACE
X-WINGS and RAZORCRAFT FIGHTERS speed out of the bay,
followed by troop transports and cargo dropships.
Poe races toward the Falcon. Chewie and BB-8 follow.
POE
No! We don’t have enough pilots.
Get out there and do some damage.
CHEWBACCA
BRAAAGGGGH!
POE
I don’t know, pick one!
Chewie looks around, spots an ORANGE X-WING. Cocks his head.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - COMMAND DECK - DAY
Hux enters the command deck overlooking the Boulevard. Smoke
rises between the buildings.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Chancellor, we’ve detected a ship
in orbit. One of ours but with
unrecognized signature codes.
CHANCELLOR HUX
It’s the stolen Eclipse. Summon all
Destroyers to the Capitol. We can
end this uprising and eliminate the
Resistance in one triumphant day.
EXT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - SPACE
The Millennium Falcon rockets out of the bay and joins the
Resistance attack fleet. The Sentinels unleash hell, assisted
by a squadron of TIE HUNTERS launching from within.
Poe is inundated with blasts from the larger ships. A trio of
Hunters bear down on the Falcon...then EXPLODE IN SUCCESSION.
98.
CHEWBACCA’S X-WING zips overhead, eliminating the enemy ships
with precise, focused shots.
INT. CHEWBACCA’S X-WING - COCKPIT
Chewie wears no helmet.
CHEWBACCA
BRAAAAGGGGHH!!!!!
BB-8 CHIRPS from the droid socket.
INT. FALCON - COCKPIT
Poe raises his eyebrows, impressed.
POE
That’s one hell of a pilot.
EXT. ABOVE CORUSCANT - SPACE
The Eclipse unloads a SUPERLASER on the Sentinels.
They EXPLODE as our attack fighters and transports descend
through the billowing fire to planetfall.
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY
WHOMP! The AT-MT Walker’s foot stomps down the boulevard
toward the First Order Capitol.
The new Resistance army moves with it. Thousands now. Some
with blasters, others with nothing but clubs and passion.
Finn marches out front with Rafe and his Rebel Troopers.
Dade rides out of the top hatch of the head of the AT-MT,
speaking through the booming broadcast speaker.
DADE
Rise up! Join the fight!
Small bands of REVOLUTIONARIES appear from side alleys. A
trickle building to a stream, building to a river...
But a distant sound silences them. LOCKSTEPPED BOOTS.
A THOUSAND RIOT-SUPPRESSING MANDALORIAN BRUTETROOPERS. Bulky
armored mercenaries with heavy shields and arm cannons.
99.
Sun cuts through the fog, revealing the extent of the
Capitol’s defenses: ADVANCED TANKS and WALKERS. New designs
we’ve never seen.
Finn holds the line at the sight of the oncoming forces.
FINN
Stand your ground!
Finn and the Stormtroopers are HIT WITH FIRE FROM ALL SIDES.
ON R2-D2 AND C-3PO
Walking through lasers.
A First Order Astromech Droid, R8-O8, rolls to a scomp
terminal on the side of a flipped tank and plugs in.
R2 BEEPS urgently.
C-3PO
He’s sending a distress signal!
Stop him!
Nobody’s listening to C-3PO. R2 beeps furiously.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Me? I’m not programmed for
violence, R2.
BEEEEEP! C-3PO steels himself, hustles through laser fire and
rips open the back panel of R8-O8.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
I do apologize for this.
He reaches into the droid’s innards and PULLS circuits out.
R8-08 BEEPS in distress, adding to C-3PO’s horror.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Please go quietly.
One last YANK and R8-08 sparks out. Tips, hits the ground.
R2 quickly plugs into the vacated scomp link. Sends his own
command. The belly Rail Gun stops, spins, resets and FIRES ON
THE BRUTETROOPERS.
Finn climbs up onto the flipped tank, past C-3PO who frets
over the inanimate shell of R8-O8.
100.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
I’ve done horrible things. I may
never be the same.
Shadows glide over the long boulevard.
A squadron of TIE BOMBERS CRATER the boulevard ahead of them.
Geysers of concrete spew upward. They’re about to be
decimated...
...when a fleet of X-Wings and B-Wings dive from the sky.
The Resistance ships FLY THROUGH THE TRENCH OF BUILDINGS and
hammer the Bombers, spinning them into explosive collisions.
Finn, Rafe and the Stormtroopers CHEER THE SKIES.
Resistance transports land on the boulevard behind them.
Stolen First Order AT-ATs, AT-STs, and ATTACK SPEEDERS emerge
from the cargo doors. They are heavily modded, painted with
revolutionary colors, eyes and teeth.
Resistance Troops pour out of landing transports.
FINN
You feel that?
Finn swells with hope.
FINN (CONT'D)
We are the Resistance! All of us!
CUT TO:
EXT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Rain pounds the grey stone, lit by flashes of blue and red.
Lightsabers CLASH as Rey and Kylo fight mercilessly on the
steps of the Temple. Ancient statues crumble--Rey stops them
in midair, pushing them back.
KYLO
I could have been your teacher.
Rey loses ground. Doubts herself. Stumbles.
KYLO (CONT'D)
I could have ended your pain.
Rey SLICES KYLO’S MASK, shearing the bottom right half clean
off, revealing the flesh beneath.
101.
He REMOVES IT. Eye to eye now. She parries and ATTACKS.
KYLO (CONT'D)
You’re weakening.
Kylo allows Rey’s barrage to hammer him, taking careful,
controlled counter strikes through her wild assaults.
KYLO (CONT'D)
The last glimmer of a dying light.
Kylo STRIKES--a wicked blow across her face that instantly
cauterizes a scar from her left cheek to her forehead.
Rey’s lightsaber drops to the stone.
She falls to her knees and SCREAMS, CLUTCHING HER EYES.
When she opens them, the world is an abstract blur of light.
She’s BLINDED.
Kylo stands over her, lightsaber pointed to her heart.
Rey looks up. CRYING BLOOD.
Rey falls backwards down the stone steps. Motionless.
KYLO (CONT'D)
Goodbye, scavenger.
Kylo enters the Temple of Mortis, leaving Rey blind and
bleeding on the steps.
CUT TO:
EXT. ABOVE CORUSCANT - SPACE
The Falcon buzzes the surface of the Eclipse, picking off
attackers. Chewbacca’s X-Wing flies right with it.
WHOOMMMM. A FINALIZER STAR DESTROYER arrives from hyperspace.
It FIRES ON THE ECLIPSE, hitting the deflector shields.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Leia swivels in her chair, conducting the revolution.
LEIA
Engage starboard cannons!
102.
EXT. ABOVE CORUSCANT - SPACE
Gun ports on the side of the Eclipse open, pushing out twenty
massive ION CANNONS like a pirate ship. They fire in unison.
The Finalizer stutters from the barrage and EXPLODES.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Leia clenches her fist amidst cheers of victory.
WHOOMMM WHOOMMM WHOOMMMM. Ten more Destroyers arrive at once.
An armada of sizes and classes.
Her confidence drains.
LEIA
Come about!
The Eclipse TURNS ON ITS AXIS and UNLEASHES HELL. The lasers
light up the dark like Christmas.
The First Order Destroyers fire back, faster and more
propulsive than we’re used to--their relative scale to the
Eclipse lets us feel their SPEED for the first time.
EXT. CORUSCANT - AIR BATTLE - DAY
The Resistance ships weave and glide between buildings,
firing on TIE Hunters at window-level of the profiteers who
financed this conflict.
A tight squadron reaches the Capitol itself. Their leader,
ELLO ASTY, sends a pair of HOMING MISSILES into the
structure. They HIT BIG.
ION CANNONS on motorized swivels rise up from the structure’s
roof, blasting ships out of the sky with deadly precision.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - WAR ROOM - NIGHT
Chancellor Hux watches a HOLOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THE
AIR BATTLE.
CHANCELLOR HUX
How is this not over?
COMMANDER SELLIK
It’s the stolen Dreadnaught, sir.
Our fleet isn’t equipped to engage
a ship of that magnitude--
103.
CHANCELLOR HUX
I mean ALL OF IT.
BOOM. An explosion ROCKS THE CAPITOL, flickering the lights.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
Rose sneaks through the crisp white hallway. She ducks into a
recess--a procession approaching, Commander Sellik in the
center of it.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Ready the hyperdrive.
Rose holds a gasp. The Capitol is a SHIP.
COMMANDER SELLIK (CONT'D)
In the unlikely event our defenses
are breached we’ll make the jump to
lightspeed.
She watches the First Order Techs break away. They scan the
ID bars on their uniforms and disappear through a door.
Rose sneaks to a window overlooking A VAST ARCHITECTONIC
ABYSS encircling the spine of the Capitol.
Attached to the spine like a vertebra, the cubed TRANSMISSION
JAMMER. Completely encased in armor with no bridges or access
points. She can’t reach it.
Removes those confiscated First Order ID bars from a hidden
pocket. Scans the door. It OPENS.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - NAVIGATION ROOM - DAY
Rose creeps into a control room stacked with nav consoles.
FIRST ORDER TECH
Prepare for surface disengagement.
Ready engines for hyperspace.
(off the NAV TECH’s look)
Purely precautionary.
She slips behind consoles and opens a panel in the floor.
INT. NAVIGATION SUBSPACE - DAY
Rose crawls down into the subspace beneath the control room,
surrounded by the wired computer towers that power the
hyperdrive. The Techs are still audible above.
104.
NAV TECH (OS)
Ready to set coordinates, sir.
TECH (OS)
Plot a course for the Forve System.
Rose opens a panel to hyperdrive computer’s motherboard and
goes to work.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SPACE
Poe zips between a pair of burning Destroyers as they COLLIDE
BEHIND HIM. Swarming TIES and chaos outside his cockpit.
POE
Chewie, get down there, they need
you! I’ve got this under control.
He doesn’t.
INT. CHEWBACCA’S X-WING - SPACE
BB-8 beeps frenetically.
CHEWBACCA
RWOOAARGGHGH!
Chewbacca spins and DIVES, breaking into the atmosphere.
EXT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - DAY
Chewbacca’s X-Wing descends to the Capitol, weaving through
the grid of lasers fired upwards by the Ion Cannons.
He makes an ATTACK RUN over the cannon arrays, taking out
several turrets with one continuous, dizzying display of
aeronautical badassery.
INT. CHEWBACCA’S X-WING - DAY
Alarm warnings. Multiple lock-ons. TIE Fighters swarm around
Chewie, ganging up.
BB-8 CHIRPS, concerned. Chewie ROARS, also concerned.
BLAM! They’re HIT. Chewie maneuvers over Monument Square,
spinning into a DIVE.
105.
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
The Orange X-Wing makes a distressed landing, knocking over
Brutetroopers in its path as it comes to a screeching stop.
FINN
Save that pilot!
Finn and his squad blast their way toward the crashed ship.
He climbs onto the wing, BB-8 beeps frantically.
FINN (CONT'D)
BB-8?
The cockpit pops open. Chewbacca ROARS.
FINN (CONT'D)
Chewie! Where’d you learn to fly
like that?
CHEWBACCA
(before you were born)
WRARRRRWRRRGGGHH!
RAFE
Incoming!
A fresh batch of HEAVY AT-MTs emerge. Cannon fire rains down
from the Capitol above.
This revolution may not last long.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Leia is weary but steadfast.
LEIA
Change our plane of attack! Don’t
let them line up on us!
Connix interrupts urgently.
CONNIX
General, our agent on the inside is
contacting you.
LEIA
We have an agent on the inside?
Connix activates her comm speaker.
106.
ROSE (VO)
(crackling)
The Capitol is a ship!
LEIA
Rose? Slow down.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - CONTROL SUBSPACE - DAY
Rose is patched into a comm terminal, sparks falling around
her. Hotwired cables string between CPU towers.
ROSE
They’re going to leave the planet! I
can disable the hyperdrive but I need
the keycodes in R2’s memory drive.
INTERCUT WITH ECLIPSE
LEIA
R2’s with Finn.
(to Connix)
Patch her through.
ROSE
(lights up)
Finn’s alive?!
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
Finn takes cover behind a fallen AT-ST. Yells into his comm.
FINN
(into comm)
Rose, you’re alive! Stay where you
are, we’re coming for you!
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - CONTROL SUBSPACE - DAY
Rose rolls her eyes, about to save everyone’s ass.
ROSE
Great! Listen carefully. I need R2
to transfer me the hyperdrive keys
before this thing takes off.
FINN (COMM)
Hyperdrive? Where are you?
107.
ROSE
There’s a scomp link terminal at
the base of the Capitol. I’ll have
a direct connection to him from
there. Got it?
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
Finn looks around frantically.
FINN
R2!! Where are you!
He spots C-3PO and R2-D2 behind a flipped tank. Races to
them, grabs R2-D2.
FINN (CONT'D)
We need to get you to the Capitol.
C-3PO
Master Finn, we’re more suited for
rear unit duty.
Finn looks out at the battlefield, eyeing the path to the
base terminal. First Order transports touch down ahead. Even
more Brutetroopers spill out into the Square.
FINN
None of this matters if we don’t
reach that terminal.
R2 BEEPS, determined.
C-3PO
For glory? What are you saying, R2?
There is no glory for droids!
BLAM! R2-D2 takes a direct hit from a cannon blast. He hits
the side of the tank and falls hard.
No comical squeal. He’s silent and scorched black. Unmoving.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
R2? R2!
FINN
Chewie cover us!
Finn hunkers over R2. Chewbacca stands tall, firing away.
C-3PO
R2! R2 say something!
108.
Finn waves smoke away from R2’s burnt body. The droid’s
circuits are dead, no power.
FINN
Those codes are in here somewhere.
Finn opens a panel and removes R2’s MEMORY DRIVE.
FINN (CONT'D)
I’m sorry, buddy.
(yells)
BB-8!
BB-8 rolls up, ready for duty. Finn opens a compartment in
the droid’s round body and inserts R2’s memory drive.
FINN (CONT'D)
It’s all up to you now. Okay?
(into comm)
Rose, send BB-8 the terminal
coordinates. He’s got this.
(to BB-8, confident)
You got this. Right?
BB-8 nods. Silent. Focused. His moment.
FINN (CONT'D)
Covering fire!
Finn, Chewbacca and the Stormtroopers cover as best they can.
FINN (CONT'D)
Go! Go!
BB-8 DASHES INTO THE BATTLE.
We stay right with him, tracking past a barrage of explosions
and laser blasts, through moving AT-MT legs, narrowly missing
craters and fallen Brutetroopers.
Finn watches the little guy from afar, inspired.
He looks around at the wounded Resistance, cut off and
surrounded, fighting for survival.
BOOOMMM! An explosion knocks Finn off his feet. Ears ringing.
RAFE
Fall back!
Finn yells to C-3PO, still kneeling over R2-D2’s fallen body.
FINN
Threepio! We have to move!
109.
C-3PO looks up. Hand on R2’s scorched head. Emotion like
we’ve never seen from him.
C-3PO
I can’t leave him.
Finn is speechless. Crushed by it all.
Chewbacca reaches down and HEAVES R2-D2’S SCORCHED SHELL UP
ONTO HIS BACK.
CHEWBACCA
RWWORRRRRRGHH!!!!
With one arm blasting and the other securing R2, he and Finn
race toward cover.
Chewbacca gets hit, STUMBLES. Keeps going.
Chewbacca is HIT AGAIN. Falls to one knee, almost drops R2.
Stands up.
Finn’s eyes tear up as they fire back at impossible odds.
This is how it ends.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SPACE
Poe watches enemy ships slip through their strafing attack
formations and descend toward Coruscant.
POE
We’ll have no chance down there if
these reinforcements make it
through! We need more ships!
INT. ECLIPSE - BRIDGE - SPACE
Another Star Destroyer appears from hyperspace. And another.
Leia watches the numbers shift even more out of favor.
LEIA
Luke...I’m sorry.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Kylo Ren’s long shadow precedes him into the cavern of stone.
Statues of the ANCIENTS look down into a deep void in the
center, sealed with a slab of unpolished marble.
110.
Kylo reaches out. The stone slab slides off and falls to the
ground with a THUD.
He looks down into the well beneath the temple, deep into the
heart of Mortis, eager for his reward...
It’s EMPTY. Nothing. A hole in the ground.
KYLO
No...no....
Kylo searches the rune-covered walls for answers. He finds
only arcane sculpted faces looking down at him.
He fires his saber and SLASHES AT THE STATUES, scarring the
Ancients with his rage.
LUKE (VO)
You’ve lost, Ben.
LUKE SKYWALKER steps into the light. A thin blue glow traces
his form.
KYLO
You’re dead! The Jedi are ghosts!
LUKE
The Dark Side has failed you, like
it failed my father.
KYLO
Your father was weak!
LUKE
His love for his family saved him.
I wish it could save you.
Luke looks deep into his former student’s pained eyes.
KYLO
I did what I had to do.
LUKE
You chose hate.
KYLO
I chose power!
Kylo FIRES his saber and ATTACKS. But Luke CATCHES THE BLADE
WITH HIS GLOVED HAND, stopping it in midair, stronger than
Kylo could possibly imagine.
111.
KYLO (CONT'D)
I’ll be stronger than any Skywalker
has ever been.
Their faces are inches away, separated by the red blade.
LUKE
You are no Skywalker.
EXT. TEMPLE MOUNT - NIGHT
Rey lies motionless on the stone steps, blind and bleeding in
the rain.
Then her hand MOVES. Her eyes flutter open.
REY
Luke...
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Luke’s expression changes, sensing her.
LUKE
Let go, Kylo. You can’t defeat us.
KYLO
Us?
LUKE
I am not alone. Obi Wan was right.
EXT. TEMPLE MOUNT - NIGHT
Rey drags her shattered body up the Temple steps. Her arm
gives out. She collapses. The pain is too much.
LUKE (VO)
We’re connected. All living things.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia looks beyond the battle, feeling Rey’s pain.
LEIA
Rey.
LUKE (VO)
The Force surrounds us.

INT. CAPITOL NAVIGATION SUBSPACE - DAY
Rose winces from spark as she rewires the hyperdrive on the
Capitol, fingertips bleeding. She LOOKS UP. A feeling.
LUKE (VO)
It penetrates us.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - NIGHT
Poe flies through a barrage of laser fire.
LUKE (VO)
It binds the galaxy together.
He feels the connection from across the galaxy.
POE

EXT. TEMPLE MOUNT - NIGHT
Rey into the rain.
REY
Poe...

Finn...
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - SUNSET
Finn is crouched low behind cover, lasers flying overhead.
LUKE (VO)
We are one. Bound by the Force.
Finn feels the connection. A surge of hope.
FINN
Fight, Rey. Fight.
EXT. TEMPLE MOUNT - NIGHT
Rey HEARS HIM. He’s there with her. They all are.
FINN (VO)
(a distant echo)
Fight...
113.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Luke gives his former student a faint smile.
LUKE
And we will not be broken.
EXT. TEMPLE MOUNT - NIGHT
With all her strength, the Last Jedi rises.
She unwraps a strip of cloth from the bandage on her hand.
Uses it to BLINDFOLD HER EYES.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Luke VANISHES.
Beyond him, REY STANDS TALL IN THE ARCHED DOORWAY.
Blind, bruised, determined.
REY
Our Masters were wrong. I will not
deny my anger. And I will not
reject my love.
Her fallen lightsaber flies into her hands.
REY (CONT'D)
I am the darkness. And I am the
light.
KYLO
You are nothing! You are no one!
She ignites the blades. They crackle.
REY
No one is no one.
Kylo CHARGES. Their blades meet and SIZZLE.
Rey fights him BLINDFOLDED. Guided by the Force.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - SPACE
Burning Resistance cruisers plummet to landfall. Leia watches
the fiery carnage out her observation window. It’s over.
114.
CONNIX
More ships arriving from the Outer
Rim, General.
LEIA
Prepare to retreat.
CONNIX
These aren’t First Order ships.
Leia looks out at the starfield ahead. Off her surprise--
A THOUSAND SHIPS APPEAR FROM HYPERSPACE.
A massive fleet of smugglers and thieves flying tricked-out,
junkyard-bound personal cruisers. The pirates Han Solo spent
half his life running from.
In the lead is Lando’s personal starship, THE LADY LUCK.
INT. LADY LUCK - SPACE
Lando Calrissian helms the controls.
LANDO
Thought you could use a few
scoundrels.
NY NYLIN, an aging alien in a vintage bomber jacket, shakes
his head the co-pilot’s chair.
NY NYLIN
(I’m too old for this shit)
Neyyid ubb nud wunn.
Lando’s ragtag fleet ATTACKS, covering for the larger
battleships as they lay waste to the enemy.
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY
A burning Tie Hunter CRASHES into the army of Brutetroopers
and tanks in the square.
Finn looks up. A battalion of ships he’s never seen before
join the firefight in the sky.
FINN
What? YEAH!!!
He raises his rifle in the air, yelling to all who can hear.
115.
FINN (CONT'D)
Chewie!
(thrilled declaration)
We got company!
EXT. CAPITOL BASE TERMINAL - DAY
BB-8 reaches the Capitol base and PLUGS INTO THE TERMINAL.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - CONTROL SUBSPACE - DAY
Rose receives the feed on her hacked CPU tower. The panel
lights up with a flood of keycodes.
ROSE
Atta boy.
INT. ECLIPSE - BRIDGE - SPACE
The First Order fleet takes a beating.
CONNIX
First Order forces are in retreat!
Send more ships to the Capitol!
Leia smiles as relief washes over her.
LEIA
(into comm)
Poe, get down there.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SPACE
Poe steers the Falcon into a steep descent straight down.
POE
Copy that.
The Falcon starts ONE LONG DESCENT FROM SPACE INTO THE CITY.
Poe takes out TIE Hunters as he goes, firing the Falcon’s
forward cannons until they JAM DRY.
The ship dives into the canyon of buildings, leveling out on
a trajectory toward the legion of AT-MTs on the Boulevard.
The Falcon BUZZES over the heads of Poe and Chewbacca...
116.
...and CRASHES THROUGH THE LEGS OF THE WALKERS, cutting the
mechanical beasts off at the knees, toppling them all as it
sparks out into Monument Square.
The ship grinds to a stop at the base of the Capitol. The
accumulated pile of fallen walkers and crashed ships creates
a BARRICADE ON THE FRONT STEPS.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - DAY
Alarms blare. Commanding Officers frantically prepare for
departure. Hux eyes the crashed Falcon in the square below.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Bomb the city! Decimate every last
being!
COMMANDER SELLIK
Our forces are outnumbered, sir.
Hux realizes the tragic truth. He lost the star wars.
INT. CHANCELLOR HUX’S CHAMBER - DAY
Hux storms into his lush chamber.
Goes to the collector’s case. Removes one of his prized
vintage lightsabers.
He activates it and IMPALES HIMSELF WITH THE PURPLE BLADE.
Hux kneels, the glowing saber protruding from his chest as
First Order ships descend in smoke and fire out the window.
CUT TO:
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Kylo counters Rey’s every move. They are evenly matched, two
sides of a coin, flame and shadow. Fighting to the death.
A vicious swing and Kylo’s lightsaber SHATTERS at the hilt.
DESTROYED, along with several fingers on his left hand, cut
across the palm.
He looks at it with disbelief, stumbles back toward the empty
Well of Mortis. Falls to one knee.
Rey stands over him. Anger flowing.
117.
She separates her dual-lightsaber. Holds one blade pointed to
Kylo’s chest.
Kylo is stunned by powerful being before him. She’s almost
glowing. Unfathomable LIVING FORCE within.
Kylo clenches his teeth...eyes furious...
A rage like we haven’t seen since Anakin...
He reaches out the open palm of his good hand...
....and EXTRACTS THE LIVING FORCE FROM REY as Tor Valum
taught him.
She RISES, energy flowing from her body into Kylo’s hand as
the life DRAINS FROM HER.
She pulls her blindfold off and SCREAMS TO THE SKY.
Kylo stands tall. Energized. His face has RETURNED TO NORMAL.
Healed. He pulls the iron plates off his skin--they fall
away, healthy flesh underneath.
He looks beyond Rey to the empty Well of Mortis.
KYLO
The were wrong. All of them. The
power of this place can’t be taken.
REY
Ben...
KYLO
But it’s nothing compared to you.
Kylo TAKES MORE FROM HER.
Rey is almost gone. Drained of life. She summons all her
strength. Reaches out.
With the last of herself, she OFFERS HIM HER HAND.
REY
Ben...please...
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia feels the disturbance. It PAINS her. Into the vastness
of space, she says her son’s name.
LEIA
Ben...
118.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Then Kylo hears HIS MOTHER’S VOICE, carried by the Force.
LEIA (VO)
Ben.
He STOPS. Hearing her. Feeling her close.
LEIA (VO) (CONT'D)
Come back. Come home.
Something HAPPENS to Kylo when he hears his mother’s voice.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia speaks to her son through the Force.
LEIA
Help us.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Kylo feels the very thing that destroyed Anakin. But doesn’t
make him feel weak.
He looks at Rey’s outstretched hand...and TAKES IT.
THE LIVING FORCE FLOWS BACK INTO HER.
Both light and dark swirl within Rey as Kylo is reduced to an
empty shell. A man without power. A frightened boy.
Kylo and Rey collapse into one another, each propping the
other up on their knees.
Rey is close to him now. Their foreheads touching.
He is weakened, spent. In the last moments of his life.
KYLO
Solana.
Rey is stunned to hear her name. Distant, like a memory.
KYLO (CONT'D)
Your name.
(last breath)
Rey Solana.
Those words are Ben Solo’s last.
119.
Rey watches the light dim in his eyes. But it is the light.
REY
Goodbye Ben.
With a look that could be perceived as love, BEN SOLO DIES.
Rey releases her hold. Collapses. Barely alive herself.
They’ve fought to the death.
EXT. CAPITOL STEPS - SUNSET
Finn appears through smoke. Blood-stained, dirty. A hero.
Rafe and the other renegade Stormtroopers behind him.
Poe climbs out of the Falcon cockpit. Chewbacca helps him.
Finn regards his old friend, amazed at his transformation.
He spots a fallen RESISTANCE FLAG on the ground. Picks it up.
Hands it to Finn.
Finn takes the flag, climbs up the angled bow of the crashed
Midnight Oiler to the top of the barricade of ships.
Poe and Chewbacca scale it with him.
Finn WAVES THE FLAG FOR ALL TO SEE.
The ground SHAKES. They all look up as the First Order
Capitol leaves its moorings.
POE
Everybody get back!
A thunderous BOOM as the Capitol RISES INTO THE SKY.
FINN
Rose is still in there!
Finn spots BB-8 rolling toward them from the quaking base.
FINN (CONT'D)
BB-8! Where is she?
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - ESCAPE POD BAYS - DAY
Rose races through the quaking Capitol. Checks a hand-drawn
map on her hand, rounds a corner toward a bay of ESCAPE PODS.
Climbs inside one, shuts the door.
120.
It LAUNCHES as the Capitol RISES. A short trip before it
CRASH LANDS onto the battlefield.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - COMMAND DECK - DAY
Commander Sellik looks down at the shrinking metropolis
below. The massive structure casts a shadow over the city.
SELLIK
Ready for lightspeed.
EXT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - DAY
Finn rushes to Rose’s crashed escape pod.
FINN
Rose!
(touches her face)
Are you okay?
Touches his hand, affectionately.
ROSE
I’m fine.
She looks up at the rising Capitol, backlit against the
setting sun. Poe, Chewie, BB-8 and C-3PO follow her eyes.
C-3PO
They’re getting away!
FINN
Did you disable the hyperdrive?
ROSE
I couldn’t figure it out.
Hope falls away. The war is lost.
ROSE (CONT'D)
So I made some adjustments to their
navacomputer. Without precise
calculations that thing could--
The Capitol JUMPS TO LIGHTSPEED. The moment it vanishes:
BOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!
It COLLIDES WITH A DISTANT PLANET. The impact is so massive,
so galaxy-shaking, it’s visible for light years.
121.
ROSE (CONT'D)
...fly right into a star.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - SPACE
Leia shields her eyes at the enormous EXPLOSION in deep
space, pulsating in the starry twilight.
A beacon of hope.
Radio communications instantly CRACKLE TO LIFE.
A CACOPHONY OF VOICES fill the frequency waves, calling on
their brethren to fight.
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
Finn, Poe, Rose, Chewie and the droids all look up. Awed,
inspired. But they can’t celebrate. Not yet.
He looks at Finn. Speaking volumes.
FINN
You feel it too.
Poe nods, affirming their connection. Rey is gone.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Rey lies flat on the stone.
Silence.
Light fills the space around her, particles of energy
floating up. She RISES with them...
The light engulfs the frame until we reach a place beyond
what we know.
THE ASTRAL PLANE
Glimmers of energy flicker like fireflies in darkness.
Rey opens her eyes. Clear again. Unburdened.
Three of the distant glimmers grow larger than the others.
She moves toward them.
YODA, LUKE SKYWALKER and OBI-WAN KENOBI.
122.
REY
Is this death?
OBI-WAN
In this place, there is no such
thing as death.
REY
I can see.
OBI-WAN
Your true self is free of
suffering. Free of pain.
YODA
Taught us much, you have.
REY
I’ve taught you?
YODA
Mmm. Succeeded where we have failed.
Narrow was our point of view.
LUKE
You chose to embrace the Dark Side
and the Light. To find balance
within.
YODA
Co-exist, they must, as such
feelings do in all of us.
REY
But if I’m here...with you...
YODA
A choice, you must make. To return,
or to remain.
LUKE
Here, there is serenity. Knowledge.
Peace. Those lost, but not forgotten.
She looks beyond them at the shimmering flecks of energy.
REY
And there?
OBI-WAN
There you will face a galaxy in
turmoil. Pain, suffering. The loss
of those you love.
123.
YODA
But living you will be.
Love, you shall.
We hold on Rey’s face as she considers the life she’s yet to
live...and makes her decision.
REY
Thank you.
The spirits fade into the cosmic Force. As the light
overwhelms us, Obi-Wan Kenobi’s voice echoes...
OBI-WAN (VO)
You are a Jedi, Rey Solana. But you
will not be the last.
EXT. CORUSCANT - DAY
A Resistance Flag rises from the rubble at the site of the
old Capitol. Thousands of citizens fill the square. Free.
INT. CEREMONIAL HALL - DAY
Heroes at attention. LEIA SKYWALKER ORGANA in elegant white.
Lando Calrissian and her top Generals around her.
Finn, Rose, Poe and Chewie stand before Leia. She places
Medals of Honor around each of their necks. BB-8 beeps
excitedly at their feet.
After 40 years of service, Chewie gets a medal.
EXT. LANDING PLATFORMS - SUNSET
Leia looks down at the blue beacon bracelet once used to
guide Rey back to safety, clenched tight in her hand.
Finn and Rose stand by her side.
LEIA
I can’t feel her presence.
Finn bows his head. Neither can he.
LEIA (CONT'D)
But there’s a calm I’ve never felt.
Balance.
FINN
That’s her.
124.
Leia smiles. BB-8 rolls up, beeps to Rose and Finn.
ROSE
Come on. We have work to do.
Leia approaches Poe and Chewbacca, also on their way. She
places the beacon bracelet in Poe’s hand.
POE
I’ll never stop looking.
Chewbacca gives her a giant Wookiee hug.
LEIA
Okay, okay. Easy.
Finn approaches Poe, holding something under his arm.
FINN
Let me know what you find.
POE
I will.
Finn hands Poe his old leather jacket.
FINN
For good luck.
Poe smiles. Takes it. Hugs him. Chewbacca GROWLS.
We follow Poe and Chewie to the MILLENNIUM FALCON, rebuilt to
look better than it has in decades.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SPACE
Poe flips switches in the cockpit.
POE
Ready, Chewie?
He takes Rey’s beacon and hangs it, replacing Han’s dice.
INT. LEIA’S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Leia watches from her window as the Millennium Falcon jets
off into the starfield.
The Phantom Hawk rockets the other way into empty space.
Leia checks on R2-D2, still under construction. A REPAIR
DROID works on rebuilding his destroyed frame.
125.
LEIA
How’s he coming along?
C-3PO
A quick cycle through his memory
banks and he’ll be his old self
again. I hope.
LEIA
He’ll be fine, 3-PO.
C-3PO
I can’t imagine what I’d do without
him. I know he’s stubborn but I, I--
LEIA
I know.
Leia picks up R2-D2’s intact memory drive, rescued by BB-8.
She inserts it into R2-D2, reminiscent of the first time we
saw the Princess with a droid.
R2 BEEPS TO LIFE.
As his files catalogue into chronological order, he projects
the contents of his memory banks...
....and we witness their adventures over 60 years, all from
the droid’s perspective.
--Luke buying C-3PO from the Jawas...
--Obi Wan giving Luke his father’s lightsaber...
--R2 flying through the Death Star trench...
--Han getting his medal on Yavin...
--Yoda lifting the X-Wing from the swamp...
--Luke saluting from the plank on Jabba’s barge...
--Leia and Han outside the bunker on Endor...
Leia is taken aback by the flood of memories. It is a
catharsis for her, and for us.
She takes a deep breath.
LEIA (CONT'D)
Thank you, R2.
Leia leaves them alone together.
R2-D2 BEEPS affectionately.
126.
EXT. LEIA’S BALCONY - NIGHT
Leia steps outside, looks up at the field of stars.
He looks up at the vastness of space.
A star falls. It gives her peace.
EXT. MODESTA - DAY
A serene, sun-dappled ranch surrounded by rolling green
fields of tall grass. Smoke curls from the chimney.
INT. HOMESTEAD - DAY
Finn sits with a circle of YOUNG KIDS, 6-11 in a sun-drenched
cabin. A fire crackles as he finishes a story.
FINN
...and the light could be seen all
over the galaxy. In every system.
Rey gave us all hope.
A LITTLE GIRL, 7, looks confused.
LITTLE GIRL
But how do you know she’s really
gone?
FINN
I don’t think she is gone. I
believe...
Finn eyes Rose, seated at a wood table, parts of a droid’s
motivator spread out in front of her. She smiles.
FINN (CONT'D)
I believe someday she’ll come back.
And when she does, we’ll be here
waiting. All of us.
The kids smile, relieved. They like that ending.
FINN (CONT'D)
Go on. Get outside.
The kids leap up and run out into daylight. Finn rises with
them and follows the last one out.
127.
EXT. MODESTA - DAY
The children race about the pasture. Dade is among them. So
is the BROOM BOY from Canto Bight.
They race around a NERF FOAL, trying to hook a ring around
its tiny horns. BB-8 races with them, beeping excitedly.
The little girl HOOKS IT. The ring flies back through the air
into her hand.
These children are FORCE SENSITIVE.
Finn and Rose have built a refuge for Force-sensitive youth
to live the life they never had.
Finn steps onto the front porch, leans against a post. The
twin sunset washes his face.
Something in that sunset changes his wistful expression.
Unclear at first, but it soon becomes a realization.
A tremor in the Force...
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEEP SPACE
Poe and Chewie in the Falcon at lightspeed.
The beacon hanging from the dash suddenly begins to GLOW.
Chewie ROARS. Poe sees it, eyes wide.
POE
Chewie, turn the ship around.
CHEWBACCA
RWWWOOORRRWWGGGHH!!!!
POE
I know, just turn around!
EXT. MODESTA - DAY
Finn notices a GLIMMER OF LIGHT in the distance. He steps
forward to get a closer look. Rose joins him, shielding her
eyes from the sun.
A figure blurs on the horizon. A familiar silhouette. Dirty,
ragged. Walking for a long time.
BB-8 rolls forward, beeps excitedly. The kids hear the droid,
stop their game, look to the fields beyond.
128.
ON THE HORIZON
Rey Solana.
Her eyes are restored, only a faint scar runs across her
forehead.
The kids run toward her, joined by BB-8, who is faster.
Rey walks on toward the homestead.
Here she will train a new generation of Jedi and pass down
what she has learned--that only an understanding of the
balance within can lead to peace and justice in the galaxy.
THE END
